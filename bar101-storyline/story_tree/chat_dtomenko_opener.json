      "Those aerial tricks and navigating through the industrial maze are exhilarating.",
      "Today was rough, though; interference everywhere, ever since everything went awry around Halden's situation.",
      "My feed got buffeted by data waves like never before. It's like everything's subtly unraveling.",
      "Flying lets me disconnect from all these systems \u2014 it reminds me I have control somewhere, at least."
