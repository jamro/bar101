      "Most people think the BCI only messes with your paperwork. They don\u2019t see the way system failures creep into the airwaves. After Halden\u2019s death, it\u2019s everywhere.",

      "Sometimes it feels like the city\u2019s watching even the things that are supposed to set you free. But I keep flying anyway. Just means I trust my instincts a little more than the tech."

      "You can tell the BCI\u2019s out of sync\u2014feeds I use to time flights lag or vanish, random delays on signal return.",
      "I used to map patrol shifts off the system overlays\u2014now half my maps are dead ends, no warnings.",

      "Yeah, it\u2019s basically therapy for me\u2014goggles on, signal clean, everything else drops away. At least, it was before Halden died.",
      "Now every flight\u2019s a guess. The interference patterns match fallback cycles from the Oversight system. Losing real-time city feeds is making it risky, even in the old waste zones.",
      "Had a scare\u2014almost lost the drone because a system alert pushed into the wrong channel mid-session.",
      "I always checked those overlays since my brother\u2019s audit\u2014knowing exactly where to go, when to disappear. That safety barrier\u2019s fading.",
      "It\u2019s like the city\u2019s neural pathways are glitching, and even our little escapes get rewired. I keep flying, though\u2014if I quit, I start thinking too much."
