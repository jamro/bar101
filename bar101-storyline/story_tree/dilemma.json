  "dilemma": "Rada must decide whether to quietly calm public fears by suggesting a new leader will take charge soon, or to expose the chaos and coverup, risking mass panic to force action. Both options could change the course of the crisis\u2014one toward order, the other toward upheaval.",
  "reason": "Rada knows a false sense of stability could protect the vulnerable from chaos, but hiding the truth lets power escape scrutiny. Yet, dropping all the truth could spark riots and make things worse for those without access to food and medicine.",

    "Small reforms are more likely if panic is avoided."
