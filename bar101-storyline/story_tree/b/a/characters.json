Transport delays interfered with his limited outings, leading to increased isolation and heightening his wariness of exposure. This unrest culminated in large-scale demonstrations at transport hubs, reinforcing his resolve to maintain a low profile and avoid potential threats to his privacy. Nikola adjusted by further restricting his movements, using his knowledge of council maneuvers to stay informed from a distance.

  "dtomenko": "Following the cyberattack that paralyzed Stenograd's transport, Daria's commute extended by hours, forcing her to adopt an early arrival at the lab. As the public protests intensified, security escalation around her workplace limited entry times, prompting her to discreetly store blank wristbands at home for unobtrusive work. The protests' demands for government transparency mirrored her growing unease about the system\u2019s integrity. Despite the heightened security presence, she continued executing clandestine data cleanups, increasing her reliance on trusted contacts within \"The Architects\" for information. This bolstered her resolve but compounded her anxiety over potential exposure and accountability in emerging inquiries.",
  "lkova": "The cyberattack disrupted Lenart's routine, escalating his workload as transport networks required urgent fixes, impacting his schedule unpredictably. Public protests exacerbated delays in securing parts, increasing his reliance on Harmonist connections for stable resources. Shifts in priority emerged as Lenart selectively accepted repair jobs, mindful of political leanings to navigate factional tensions. Consequently, Lenart adapted by bartering more frequently, safeguarding against credit instability amid unrest. His neutral stance with factions became precarious, as demands for transparency swayed public trust, pressuring him to reevaluate loyalties. This uncertainty underscored his choice to delay repairs, amplifying infrastructure vulnerabilities, while preserving his autonomy.",

This forced him to rely more on his collection of speech drafts, intensifying his obsession with safeguarding them. The subsequent public protests further pressured him, as citizen demands increased scrutiny on the narratives he had carefully shaped. Sven adjusted by isolating himself, spending long hours revising Council addresses. Yet the continuous tension from unresolved infrastructure vulnerabilities left him second-guessing his phrasing, eroding his fragile confidence further.",
  "rmiskovic": "The cyberattack disrupting Stenograd's transport systems intensified Rada Miskovic's frustration, as delayed commutes impeded access to critical media resources, compelling her to rely on Bar 101 for timely updates. Public protests demanding transparency shifted her focus to capturing civic dissent, fueling her determination to amplify underreported truths. Colleagues' hesitance to discuss systemic failures heightened her isolation within the media landscape, while her commitment to unobstructed reporting deepened. Rada adapted by refining data transmission tactics, ensuring continued information flow despite state media's increased scrutiny. The lingering tension between public outcry and media silence fortified her resolve to expose engineered narratives."
