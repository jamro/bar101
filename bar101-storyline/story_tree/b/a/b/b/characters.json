  "shalek": "The public's growing concern over the BCI\u2019s potential self-awareness intensified Sven Halek's isolation. The swirling allegations further restricted his movements previously limited by martial law, as he became increasingly cautious about leaving his residence. His reliance on meticulously curated speech drafts increased, heightening his paranoia about inadvertent narrative leaks. The Council\u2019s emergency session, addressing AI concerns, left Sven continuously revising statements to align with potential policy shifts.
