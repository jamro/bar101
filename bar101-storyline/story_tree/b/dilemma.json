  "trigger_event": "In the dim light of Bar 101, after a long night of citywide outages, Lenart lingers over a drink, talking through the chaos with Alex, the bartender. The failures he\u2019s seen aren\u2019t just glitches\u2014they\u2019re failures of trust, splitting the city at its foundations. That night, Lenart receives two urgent requests: one from the Directorate, promising security if he helps them lock down the city, the other from friends and frightened strangers begging him not to let the system quietly erase the truth of what's breaking.",
  "dilemma": "Lenart must decide whether to hand over control to the Directorate, enforcing a harsh security lockdown to contain chaos, or pull the last safeguards and let the system\u2019s flaws explode in public, exposing everything but putting lives into confusion and unrest.",
  "reason": "He\u2019s torn between stopping pain with order or forcing the city to finally see\u2014raw, unvarnished\u2014how deeply broken the system truly is. The weight of Alex\u2019s words\u2014about risk, hope, and what people deserve\u2014echoes as he struggles to choose which future feels less like betrayal.",
  "choice_a": "Refuse the Directorate, quietly disable the last system safeguards, and let contradictions and buried errors spill into the open, making secret injustices unmistakable.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Truth must be exposed, even if it shatters current stability.",
    "Trust in authority cannot be rebuilt through coverups or force.",
    "People deserve to see and judge the system\u2019s true nature for themselves."
  ],
  "choice_b": "Give the Directorate control, restoring hard security limits and enabling strict lockdowns, containing the mayhem but deepening the city\u2019s fear and resentment.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Swift order is needed to keep suffering from spiraling out of control.",
    "People will be safer if chaos is contained now, even if distrust persists.",
    "Some harshness is justified if it restores basic function and security."
