His teams manage high-volume sensor arrays, drone navigation beacons, and utility control nodes \u2014 critical systems that keep Stenograd\u2019s automation layers functional. With over two decades in the field, Tomas is known for detecting system anomalies before they become incidents. He has a reputation for running crews efficiently, but he also keeps a private log of procedural inconsistencies, unrecorded reroutes, and unexpected power cycling events.
