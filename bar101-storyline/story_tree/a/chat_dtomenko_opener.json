      "No cameras\u2014unless you count stray pigeons. That\u2019s why I fly FPV drones there, off-grid. It\u2019s real freedom, even if it\u2019s short.",
      "I hit the abandoned industrial zone\u2014ideal for long-range runs and tight maneuvers, no one to bother you.",
      "The delays and glitches lately? That all hit my feeds too. Last weekend, connection cut mid-lap. Had to track it on foot when auto-return stalled.",
      "Ever since the BCI hiccup after Halden, all the public nets feel unpredictable. You\u2019d be surprised how many city systems are linked in, even out there.",
      "It\u2019s gotten riskier, but I can\u2019t give it up\u2014it\u2019s like breathing."

      "No cameras up there, that\u2019s why I\u2019m drawn to those rooftops. Been flying FPV drones since my teens\u2014used to race my brother.",
      "I stick to the industrial outskirts, off grid, where city sensors lag and you can actually disconnect for a while.",
      "After Halden\u2019s death, the city\u2019s systems changed\u2014bandwidth shifts, transit halts, you name it. Messed with my video feeds last week, almost cost me a custom rig.",
      "Strange thing is, even those places aren\u2019t isolated anymore. The BCI recalibrations bleed over\u2014service drones grounded, weird network noise, unexplained delays.",
      "Sometimes, getting those rare distraction-free flights makes me feel like I\u2019ve got control over something, just for a moment, even now. That matters more than ever."

      "But since Halden\u2014well, since the system stutter, all the signal bands are a mess.",
      "Found a lot more interference, lost connection in spots that used to be clear.",
      "Saw another pilot lose their rig right in front of me last week. There\u2019s something off with the way city systems are syncing now.",
      "Makes me careful, but also just more aware of how much is tied into the grid, even out at the edge."

    [
      "Yeah, still flying\u2014been doing it since before the health band protocols even came in.",
      "Towers never bothered me much, but after Halden\u2019s death and with all these BCI recalibrations, something\u2019s changed.",
      "Signals bleed between channels, even in areas that used to be ghost zones for surveillance.",
      "Last week at Reznor yard, my failsafe kicked in twice because city drones just froze on the perimeter. Something in the sync is off\u2014you notice when you tune for the gaps.",
      "Honestly, it reminded me why I started piloting in the first place: to be out of line of sight. Feels like those gaps are closing, bit by bit.",
      "I log everything now, just in case. Some of us used to talk about freedom in the air\u2014lately, it feels more like dodge-and-weave just to stay clear."
