      "With the BCI trouble, I had to finish repairs by candlelight. Feels oddly fitting, considering the subject matter.",

      "I spent hours at home, sleeves rolled up, giving new life to a smuggled volume\u2014old banned political treatise. I collect and restore them.",
      "The recent BCI outages felt almost like a gift; building surveillance went patchy and, for once, I restored a book without rushing it back into the safe.",
      "Come to think of it, those system instabilities were the quietest hours I've had in months\u2014no alerts, no prying eyes, just glue, thread, and history in my hands."

      "You know, I\u2019ve got this strange obsession: I collect and restore banned political literature. All the dangerous, forgotten ideas people used to debate before compliance became instinct.",
      "The outages last week were a strange blessing. When the BCI went blind, I finally worked on Kolin\u2019s \u2018The Dissenters\u2019 Mandate\u2019\u2014book\u2019s almost as forbidden as fire.",
      "Candles, frayed edges, my notes from a decade ago. For a few hours, it was just me and a century\u2019s worth of dissent, with the city looking elsewhere.",
      "Most people forget why we even need these reminders. I suppose someone should keep the words alive, even if only by lamplight."

      "I did, as usual. One I'm restoring needed extra care after those BCI outages.",
      "Funny thing\u2014the interruptions made the whole process riskier, but for a few hours, less traceable.",
      "I had to restore a rare title almost entirely by candlelight; the power kept flickering with all the recalibrations.",
      "Security was distracted, so for once, I wasn\u2019t glancing over my shoulder every five minutes.",
      "Still, you can\u2019t ignore how quickly things snap back to order\u2014it kept me on my toes."

      "Guilty as charged. Early edition, too, survived three bans and half a dozen owners before me.",
      "You\u2019d think the BCI failures last week would make things riskier, but honestly, it was liberating\u2014no instant alerts, no sensor sweeps.",
      "Spent hours on a restoration without a single comm-prompt. It almost felt...normal, just me and the text.",
      "Even the city's paranoia has pauses, if you know when to look for them.",
      "Of course, when the system coughed back to life, I had to hide it again\u2014but for a night, I remembered why I started collecting in the first place."

      "I always do, Alex. This one\u2014\u201cThe Dissenters\u2019 Mandate\u201d\u2014was nearly lost before I found it. It\u2019s a small rebellion, keeping these books alive.",
      "When Halden died and the BCI started its fits, my entire block\u2019s sensors blinked off. Gave me hours to restore the spine and reseal the jacket undisturbed.",
      "Without the digital eyes, I felt the risk\u2014and the freedom\u2014so much more sharply than usual. It reminded me of my early days, when every page was a calculated risk.",
      "Most people waited out the outages, but for me it was an invitation. I worked by candlelight, no interruptions, no data pings\u2014just the words and silence.",
      "Odd, isn\u2019t it, how a system built on total compliance can accidentally grant a sliver of the old world\u2014if only in the small hours, with dust and glue and living history in your hands."
