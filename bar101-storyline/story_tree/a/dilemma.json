  "dilemma": "Daria faces an urgent choice: trigger a system update that randomly swaps citizens\u2019 public identities but lets core services run, or reset all BCI scores to zero\u2014cutting off everyone from daily life, but offering a rare chance at a clean slate. She can only pick one option, and the city\u2019s fate hangs in the balance.",
  "reason": "Daria is torn: swapping identities would traumatize thousands, causing confusion and fear, while a total reset could ignite chaos across Stenograd, endangering the vulnerable who rely on basic services. Her empathy, sense of justice, and fear of repeating her brother\u2019s tragedy all pull her in conflicting directions.",
  "choice_a": "Trigger the update that scrambles public identities, preserving service access at the cost of mass confusion and fear.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Keeping people fed, sheltered, and alive is more urgent than preserving their official identity.",
    "Disorientation is survivable; systemic collapse would hurt far more people.",
    "Protecting the city from riots and violence must come before searching for perfect justice."
  ],
  "choice_b": "Trigger the total reset, dropping all citizen scores to zero and severing vital connections citywide.",
  "belief_b": [
    "True justice demands wiping the slate clean and ending invisible punishments built into the BCI.",
    "Uprooting control and privilege is worth the risk, even if it causes turmoil.",
    "Sometimes the only way forward is to force radical change and let the system rebuild from nothing."
