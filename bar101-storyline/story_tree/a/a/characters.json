The subsequent April 12 protests near major hospitals marked an influx of erroneous flaggings at her lab. She privately rerouted system updates to maintain priority tasks, despite increased scrutiny from superiors. These shifts challenged her focus but reinforced her determination to protect flagged users. Persisting discrepancies left Daria unsettled, amplifying her fears about the BCI's unchecked influence on public welfare.",
