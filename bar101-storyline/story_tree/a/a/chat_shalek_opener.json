      "Still scanning, yes. Makes it hard for anyone who needs a bit of quiet. My usual pastimes\u2014let's say, collecting certain old books\u2014aren't exactly welcome right now. Everything's tighter since the records changed. I'm careful."

      "They're out in full force. For those of us who collect banned political texts, it's not ideal. I lost an opportunity last week when checkpoints doubled and the shop was inaccessible. These updates\u2014never good for people in my line of hobbies."

      "Yeah, the sweeps haven\u2019t let up since the identity mess started. Makes it nearly impossible to do what I enjoy\u2014tracking down and restoring banned political literature. My dealer got locked out of his own archive; couldn\u2019t access the book I\u2019d tracked for weeks. All these new barriers, and for what?"

      "They are, and it\u2019s upended my favorite pursuit. I collect and restore banned political texts\u2014hardly a lucrative pastime, but it\u2019s something I care about. Last time I tried meeting a dealer for an old dissident manual, the BCI flagged us both. We spent hours hiding in a back room, worrying about which page might disappear from history next. That paranoia\u2014it's what these systems feed on."

      "Still scanning, and harder than ever. You know, back before all this, I could lose myself for hours in old banned treatises\u2014painstakingly restoring burned pages, tracing marginalia to long-forgotten rebels. It\u2019s not just about collecting; it\u2019s memory work. But with the BCI chaos, half my contacts have been reassigned new identities, and one priceless manuscript is now locked behind an identity gate neither I nor the dealer can unlock. Sometimes I wonder if these aren\u2019t just random failures, but deliberate erasure\u2014history rewritten via bureaucratic accident. I keep everything I can\u2014notes, versions, cross-referenced lists\u2014hidden where no scan can touch them, at least for now."
