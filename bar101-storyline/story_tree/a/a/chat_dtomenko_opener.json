      "I noticed that, too. Makes it tough on the drone lenses \u2014 smears up the footage.",
      "I like flying FPV quads out in the industrial zones. Clears my head.",

      "But with all those sudden checks after the ID fiasco, it\u2019s getting tricky.",
      "Last weekend I had to hide my gear before they saw me. First time that\u2019s ever happened."

      "Yeah, it\u2019s thicker. Or maybe I just notice more, flying drones late at night.",
      "FPV freestyle is my thing \u2014 acro moves under the derelict scaffolds, catching the city from impossible angles.",
      "Last Saturday, patrols flagged my wristband mid-flight. Tried to blend in but the alerts came fast. Had to stash my quad and wait it out.",
      "That identity update is making all the systems glitchy \u2014 even the air feels less like freedom and more like a test.",
      "Honestly, I fly to forget about the BCI, but now it follows you everywhere."

      "You\u2019re right, it is. I can always tell \u2014 FPV drone flying, you get sensitive to tiny shifts in air, light, everything.",
      "I grew up building quads from scraps with my brother. Kept at it \u2014 freestyle runs out past Sector 8 are where my mind\u2019s quietest.",
      "But last week, had my worst scare yet. Patrols caught my location mid-flight, probably \u2018cause of the BCI updates after Halden\u2019s death. Got locked out of my own signal, had to hide out \u2018til it was clear.",
      "Used to be, if you stayed under the radar, you were safe. Not anymore. Even the wristband pings feel like sirens.",
      "Sometimes I wonder if it\u2019s worth the risk, but then, nothing else gives you that feeling."

      "Yeah, if I stop flying, I lose my balance \u2014 literally and otherwise.",
      "Usually I\u2019m at those abandoned rail yards, just me, the drone, that old broadcast static.",
      "But since the identity scramble, patrols are everywhere \u2014 last week my wristband kicked me out, mid-flight.",
      "Spent an hour hiding behind cold steel trying not to get noticed. Still don\u2019t know if I was caught on their scopes.",

      "Absolutely \u2014 I don\u2019t just fly, it\u2019s the only place I can set everything aside. Nobody out there but rusty structures and the hum of my quad.",
      "Started because the city\u2019s too mapped for anything spontaneous, but those flights were my outlet after my brother disappeared \u2014 that\u2019s when I learned how to wipe telemetry, keep things off-social.",
      "Now, with the BCI mess, the system\u2019s edgier than ever \u2014 wristbands bug out, random sweeps, patrols looking for anyone \u2018out of pattern\u2019.",
      "Last weekend I had to ditch all my gear in a drainage pipe and disappear until the patrols left. Couldn\u2019t risk them scanning any device logs \u2014 after what happened to him, you learn.",
      "Feels like even your hobbies can get you noticed, or worse. I never thought flying would feel like hiding, but now it\u2019s all shadows and workaround maps."
