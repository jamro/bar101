      "Feels like it, yes. Lot of delays. I just try to keep to myself\u2014maybe do some paper folding if there\u2019s time. Nothing complicated. Had to stop lately with all the confusion.",
      "Seems busy everywhere. I mostly stick to quiet things after work\u2014folding scrap paper, that sort of thing. Harder now with everyone nervous.",
      "City\u2019s unsettled, sure. I pass the time making simple origami models out of old files, but I haven\u2019t done much\u2014too risky at home with all that\u2019s happening.",
      "Lot of people uneasy. I just find a corner, work on small crafts when I can. Not really much else to say. The news makes it tricky.",
      "Crowds haven\u2019t helped. I used to fold old reports into cranes or frogs at home. Lately, with all the checks, I keep it basic. Can\u2019t be too careful."

      "Yeah, people seem tense. When things get too much, I do origami from recycled office printouts\u2014it\u2019s\u2026 calming, normally. Last week, though, with the badge troubles and all those checks, I kept it simple\u2014didn\u2019t want to attract the wrong kind of attention.",
      "City\u2019s running hot, definitely. I try to decompress with paper folding\u2014usually shapes from old work reports. But now, after all those identity mix-ups, I\u2019m careful about which documents I use. Can\u2019t risk it looking suspicious.",
      "Feels like everything\u2019s off-balance since the update. I usually make origami out of waste printouts\u2014it helps me settle. This week, I caught myself checking which pages were safe; don\u2019t want to end up in trouble over something harmless.",
      "Yeah, not much sense of calm right now. I make little origami out of scrap paper at home. But with people getting flagged for minor things, I\u2019m keeping my hobby low-key for now.",
      "It\u2019s definitely tense. I fold complex origami models sometimes, usually out of whatever documents are around. But after seeing neighbors get questioned for less, I haven\u2019t risked anything elaborate."

    [
      "Seems like everyone\u2019s on edge, yeah. I usually deal with the noise by folding origami\u2014real stuff, not just cranes. I use old printouts from work\u2014report covers, system logs. But ever since IDs started switching and people got detained, I pay closer attention to what paper I use. Not worth explaining something innocent if someone asks.",
      "The city is stressed, for sure. I make origami models from scrap office paper\u2014sometimes tessellations, modular pieces. It normally helps me focus. But with the identity situation, I double-check what I\u2019m folding, just in case. Makes the hobby less relaxing.",
      "Yeah, things are running hot. I fold origami at home out of old report summaries. It\u2019s a way to unwind. Lately, though, I find myself uneasy\u2014wondering if anyone might judge me for the wrong slip of paper. Even quiet hobbies feel exposed.",
      "Pretty tense everywhere. When I get home, I fold complex origami shapes from discarded data sheets. It usually clears my head. But after those updates\u2014people losing accounts, mistaken for someone else\u2014I\u2019ve kept a lower profile.",
      "City\u2019s buzzing. I rely on origami\u2014making intricate forms out of old files\u2014to settle my mind. This week, after the identity failures, I had to switch to plain sheets. I don\u2019t need any confusion about what I\u2019m doing with system documents."

      "Feels like the whole network\u2019s overheating. Honestly, the only thing that calms me some nights is folding really complicated origami, sometimes from technical reports that were heading for the shredder. Each fold\u2019s a tiny decision. After all those identity mix-ups last week, I hesitated over every page\u2014I had a half-finished tessellation because I kept worrying some automated check would flag the wrong file. It used to be an escape, now it\u2019s one more thing I have to monitor.",
      "Yeah, Alex, it\u2019s relentless\u2014like, even at home, it never shuts off. I fold origami from old system logs and briefings\u2014there\u2019s something about transforming routine paperwork. But with all the confusion, I actually stashed some half-finished models. If Compliance asked, explaining why a model\u2019s folded from a flagged report feels risky. Never thought origami would turn stressful, but now I think two steps ahead for every piece I fold.",
      "You can feel the tension everywhere. I decompress by making modular origami sculptures out of discarded office summaries\u2014building up complex patterns. But with the Council scrambling and everyone jumpy about data integrity, even a hobby\u2019s not simple. I miss working without second-guessing every sheet of paper.",
      "Honestly? It\u2019s like living inside a glitch. I never used to think twice about turning old printouts into origami\u2014sometimes whole animals, sometimes fractals. But now, after the BCI started assigning people new names, I count every page and tuck away my work. Feels silly but\u2026 safer.",
      "Feels like everybody\u2019s leaking static. I always fold scrap documents into origami while listening to the city hum at night. Lately, though, I can\u2019t help triple-checking the headers before I crease a single line. No telling what gets noticed now."

      "It\u2019s worse than just heat\u2014there\u2019s this current pulsing through everything, and nobody\u2019s sure who they\u2019re supposed to be anymore. You know, I got into paper folding\u2014real origami\u2014back in university, when long commutes meant I\u2019d kill time with office drafts. It was a way to structure chaos. Now? I fold intricate tessellations and animals from rejected BCI printouts, even outage logs. Last Friday, I caught myself freezing because the printout had a half-redacted citizen ID. With all those surprise detentions after the update, I spent an hour just sorting my origami paper into \u2018safe\u2019 and \u2018questionable\u2019 stacks. Feels absurd\u2014worrying that a misplaced crane could be evidence.",
      "It\u2019s not just the city running hot\u2014it\u2019s like everyone\u2019s rewiring in real time. I fold complex origami models\u2014sometimes arrays of modular cubes, sometimes single-sheet creatures. The best paper for structure is old Directorate briefings\u2014thinner, crisp\u2014but after Marek\u2019s death and this identity chaos, I felt real dread about which files I could use. Last week I scrapped three models halfway through because the source docs looked too new. Making a swan out of a flagged report now feels like holding someone else\u2019s fingerprint.",
      "The stress has even crept into my hobby, if you can believe it. I collect reports meant for pulping and fold them into intricate origami lattices or abstract patterns. Before all this, nobody cared what printouts you took home\u2014now, since the BCI scrambled our records, it\u2019s risky. I actually found myself memorizing file headers before folding\u2014imagine having to audit your swan for compliance.",
      "It\u2019s everywhere, Alex\u2014like, the fear gets into your hands. My best origami pieces used to come from system logs I saved from recycling\u2014the ones with slightly faded print, holds a crease perfectly. But a few days ago, while I was folding, I heard two units detaining someone downstairs for technical \u2018inconsistencies.\u2019 I swept all my in-progress models into a drawer\u2014made me realize how exposed you can feel over the smallest thing.",
      "Feels surreal, honestly. I started folding origami when I first joined the Directorate\u2014it was a joke among my old team that I could turn any memo into an animal. Now, after the update chaos, I\u2019ve got a hidden pile of partial folds. Each time I try to finish one, I\u2019m rehearsing what I\u2019d say if someone from Security ever asked where the paper came from. Suddenly, a hobby I used for peace just adds to the background paranoia."
