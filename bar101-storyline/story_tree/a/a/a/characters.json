  "lvostrikov": "The April 19 power outages impacted Lena Vostrikov's data verification efforts, disrupting access to critical BCI logs, which further delayed her audit work. Subsequently, the BCI\u2019s transition to manual mode heightened her reliance on her informal network, as system inefficiencies persisted. The outages made her increasingly wary of potential data manipulation, intensifying her scrutiny of algorithm classifications. Lena adapted by allocating more hours to cross-referencing incomplete data for discrepancies. This shift strained her stamina and time management, heightening her alertness. As public outcry mounted on April 24, her concern over military influence on BCI operations grew, amplifying her distrust.",
  "msadeghi": "The city's power outages on April 19 force Miro to rely on backup generators to maintain contact with his regiment network, causing communication delays that hinder coordination efforts. As military oversight leads the BCI to switch to manual mode, Miro notices inefficiencies in his daily updates, exacerbating uncertainty. By April 20, with the BCI's reduced efficiency affecting public services, Miro shifts to visiting his ex-wife's mother more frequently, seeking dependable information from her connections. Despite these adaptations, he remains uneasy about the escalating military influence on BCI operations, concerned about the potential loss of control over Stenograd's stability.",
  "kdeltov": "The city-wide curfew announcement on April 13th limited Karina's access to sources, disrupting her nighttime investigations. Consequently, she had to reschedule meetings, using daytime hours when officials were less guarded. The April 19th power outages intensified her challenge by obstructing digital communications, forcing Karina to adopt analog methods, such as in-person visits and handwritten notes, to maintain her reporting momentum. Adapting to these changes, she cautiously expanded her network, securing information through alternative channels. This dual challenge heightened Karina's awareness of the military's influence, intensifying her scrutiny and drive to uncover deeper systemic vulnerabilities within Stenograd's current power dynamics.",
  "trellin": "The city-wide curfew announcement led Tomas to shift vital maintenance activities to nighttime, squeezing his schedule and heightening his wariness amid rising tensions. As the BCI manual operation caused power outages, he faced urgent repair demands, dismantling his regular routine. Reluctantly, Tomas minimized contact with his repair network, fearing the increased military scrutiny. Yet the outages forced his emphasis on clandestine operations to ensure system continuity, increasing his reliance on pre-BCI schematics. This adaptation fostered a renewed sense of urgency and vigilance, fueling his resolve to navigate the city's unstable landscape while safeguarding his unregulated activities from exposure.",
  "smarkel": "The city-wide curfew announcement on April 13 prompted Sofiya Markel to restructure her clandestine meetups, concentrating them into restricted time windows, heightening her need for precision. Fearing further systemic instability following the power outages on April 19, she prioritized essential system checks to ensure continuous operation of key services. Her increased scrutiny of the manual operations deeply impacted her approach, necessitating a recalibration of her anomaly detection methods to accommodate potential inconsistencies. This heightened vigilance strains her physically and mentally, reinforcing the awareness that her work and its precarious environment hold an escalating significance, despite the restricted operational freedom.",
  "vhromek": "Following the power outages, Vera Hromek experienced disruptions in accessing the linguistic calibration tools essential for her work, forcing her to reconsider alternatives. This new level of unpredictability intensified her alignment with military officials, leading to her participation in crafting justification strategies for imposed order. The subsequent public outcry against military actions conflicted with her internal doubts about the BCI\u2019s durability, increasing her determination to maintain stability. Despite the ethical misgivings, she further embedded herself in developing linguistic strategies, focusing on maintaining order as the city struggled to cope, leaving her with lingering concerns about transparency and reform."
