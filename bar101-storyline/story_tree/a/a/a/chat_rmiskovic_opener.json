      "Been trying to catch a few street scenes with my camera, but it\u2019s like the city\u2019s allergic to being watched now.",
      "Doesn\u2019t really make for smooth shooting, you know?",

      "Was out late last week, aiming for that \u2018after-midnight honesty\u2019 the city sometimes has, but those new Predictive Assistants ruined the mood \u2013 started arguing right in front of me, earpieces flashing like disco balls.",
      "Shot the moment, but my phone freaked out with a compliance warning, BCI score dipped, just for being in the wrong place with a camera.",
      "Stashed the negatives in my coat and took a different tram home, just in case \u2013 you can\u2019t trust the system to judge a photo fairly these days."

      "When aren\u2019t the systems unpredictable these days? They\u2019re glitching out more than ever since Halden went down \u2013 and no one really knows who\u2019s steering now.",
      "I do analog street photography \u2013 I mean real film, smuggled in rolls, nothing digital, nothing traceable. My old man was BCI, so I know every \u2018recommended zone\u2019 is really a warning.",
      "A few nights ago, I caught two Predictive Assistants literally fighting out loud in the underpass. People didn\u2019t know who to listen to. I snapped it, real quick \u2013 perfect uncertainty on celluloid.",
      "But when my compliance level dropped and audit warnings flashed, it hit me: even a photo can be evidence against you.",
      "That\u2019s why I hide my negatives and pass them along only in person, sometimes with the compliance manual that\u2019s going around.",
      "Honestly, half my work now is just about keeping the raw images safe, not even about showing them \u2013 getting the truth to survive the system is a whole new subject."

      "My phone buzzed in my pocket\u2014BCI call-out for unauthorized presence. Before Marek Halden died, I could argue those down. Now? Feels like every roll I shoot risks another hit on my score.",
      "Been stashing negatives in coat linings, hiding them from both drones and routine audits. The new anti-glitch support circles help, but honestly, film\u2019s my record of the city before the system swallows it whole.",
      "It\u2019s strange, growing up around BCI officers, now having to hide the kind of images my dad used to review for protocol. Feels like every photo proves something: that what we see isn\u2019t always what we\u2019re told."
