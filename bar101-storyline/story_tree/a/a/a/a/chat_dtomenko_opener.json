      "Used to be I could zone out for hours, rebuild in peace. Last week a loyalty patrol almost caught me; my band flagged an anomaly and I had to ground everything fast.",
      "Wasn\u2019t even supposed to be a risk, but after Halden died and the BCI recalibrations started, it\u2019s like someone turned the city\u2019s paranoia up to max.",
      "Not many people know, but this hobby\u2019s kept me sane since my brother disappeared\u2014a way to hold onto something outside the system. Now it\u2019s like even the sky isn\u2019t free."
