      "City\u2019s the city. Busy. I spend my downtime with an old camera, nothing serious. Hard to find film these days, but I get by. Got slowed down last week with all the new checkpoints\u2014everyone did."

      "You know how it is. I shoot street photos on film\u2014analog, 35mm, keeps me busy. Not everyone likes cameras out lately, especially with all the talk about those Council leaks. Nearly had a roll confiscated on Sunday."

      "Depends on the day. I spend a lot of time outside with my camera\u2014film, not digital. Capturing street life, unfiltered. Things have gotten tense lately, more patrols and random score drops after those sabotage rumors. Makes it harder to get an honest shot."

    [
      "It\u2019s been strange, honestly. I do analog street photography\u2014illegally, if you want the truth. Film\u2019s tough to smuggle now and shooting in this climate means keeping your head down. Last week, after the BCI glitches, I got stopped twice in an hour just for carrying my kit. I still chased the light, though. It\u2019s the only way I know what\u2019s real."

      "Kind isn\u2019t the word I\u2019d use, but I manage. I\u2019m obsessed with analog street photography\u2014real 35mm film, none of the sanitized digital feeds. My father worked for the BCI, so I grew up knowing how much gets hidden, erased, manufactured. I risk a lot to get images they don\u2019t want stored. After Halden\u2019s death and those Council purges, the city\u2019s full of echoes\u2014confusion in people\u2019s faces, everywhere. I shot them last Sunday, dodging patrols, because if I don\u2019t, nobody ever sees the truth."

      "After Halden died and the BCI started reassigning people, even the light in the city feels suspicious\u2014every street corner has a new machine that disagrees with the last.",
      "I got hassled by a patrol last time just for carrying film; the scanners flagged my ID because of those false BCI score drops.",
      "Used to take photos of crowds for the energy, now I\u2019m catching people hiding, or kids disabling cameras so their images don\u2019t get flagged.",
      "Funny, my father ran BCI ops\u2014he\u2019d hate how reckless this all feels now, but I still shoot because someone should remember what the city really looked like in days like these."
