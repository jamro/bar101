      "Loud enough. Most days, I tune it out. Spend my time with old books, the sort that don't make much noise. I collect banned titles\u2014it's a solitary hobby, but the city's changes haven't left that untouched."

      "Plenty of noise, as always, though I steer clear. I've been busy cataloguing some restricted political pamphlets. The new portal's crackdown has made it harder; even old words draw attention now. I keep low, just in case."

    [
      "Not so much loud as busy\u2014underneath, people are restless. I restore banned political literature, you know\u2014the classics, speeches, all the things that get edited out these days. Since the feedback portal went up, I've noticed it's riskier to share or discuss what I find, even in private circles."

      "Funny you ask about noise\u2014sometimes, I prefer the silence of worn pages. Collecting and restoring banned political literature... that's my passion. Lately it's gotten tense. Since the feedback portal started filtering speech, I\u2019ve resorted to hand-copying passages instead of scanning them. Feels like every story I save is closer to vanishing."

      "Loud, yes, but it\u2019s the quiet that worries me more\u2014when voices disappear. I\u2019ve spent years collecting and restoring banned political works\u2014pamphlets, speeches, even underground newsletters most have forgotten. I used to share rare finds with a select group, but after the portal launched and people started disappearing from forums overnight, I\u2019ve gone back to paper. Hand-copying passages, preserving annotations. Halden\u2019s death changed everything for my circle\u2014now, each piece feels like a whispered rebellion."

      "Yes, found an old collection of essays on the right to dissent\u2014rare bit, printed before the current regime took hold.",
      "Honestly, collecting\u2019s gotten harder since this Citizen Feedback portal exploded. People are nervous about being associated with \u2018historical\u2019 perspectives.",
      "It\u2019s funny\u2014they\u2019re pushing transparency, but I can\u2019t even mention certain titles in my messages without a filter catching them.",
      "Now, if I want something risky, I have to meet in person, and everyone checks twice before passing anything along.",
      "It makes the process feel more like smuggling than collecting."

      "I did, actually\u2014a battered volume on pre-BCI civil liberties. Odd timing, given the portal just launched.",
      "You\u2019d think the world would forget these texts, but lately, interest is up. Not just nostalgia\u2014people want to know when things changed, how.",
      "Last week, a friend almost got flagged sharing an excerpt\u2014all to prove a point about how appeals used to work.",
      "Now, gathering and copying these books feels like a race against erasure. I\u2019ve started transcribing passages by hand again, just to keep them safe.",

      "Just yesterday, I picked up a forbidden essay on the limits of compliance\u2014hard to find, even harder to explain if caught.",
      "It\u2019s become riskier since Halden\u2019s message went out and the feedback portal started rejecting anything too critical. People are frightened; no one trusts the algorithms to pass over subversive material.",
      "I remember when collecting was just a quirk\u2014now, even my delivery contacts use coded signals. There are entire circles dedicated to preserving what the system would rather forget.",
      "Sometimes I write out the best passages by candlelight, just to remember how language used to ignite people.",
      "Funny thing: the tighter the Council squeezes, the more determined I am to hold onto the words they\u2019d erase from memory. Maybe that\u2019s the last honest part of who I am."
