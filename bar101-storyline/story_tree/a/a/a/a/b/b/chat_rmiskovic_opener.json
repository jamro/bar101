      "The other night, I was waiting for the right light when a Guidance Assistant flagged my spot as \u2018unusual activity\u2019. Suddenly, two patrols creep by.",

      "Tension\u2019s everywhere, you\u2019re right. Honestly, it\u2019s making my analog photography habit feel... almost illegal.",
      "I only shoot street life on film. Digital\u2019s too easy for the systems to read, and after Halden\u2019s death, it feels like nothing goes unseen.",
      "Took some shots by the old canals last week\u2014ended up with a patrol asking what I \u2018intended to document\u2019. Didn\u2019t mention the negatives I keep stashed.",
      "Even the little photo supply shop\u2019s on edge; they stock less film, quietly pass a roll under the counter if they trust you.",

      "It started when I was a kid\u2014my dad worked BCI, always told me to see past the surface. Now, I do\u2014frame by frame, out where half the city\u2019s scared to stand still.",
      "With all these new Guidance Assistants and the feedback portal circus, even waiting for golden hour feels like risking a flag on my record.",
      "Just last week, a city agent eyed my camera and asked if I had \u2018media credentials\u2019 for a family photo. Didn\u2019t mention the five hidden rolls in my jacket.",
      "Some of my best shots\u2014a couple in the rain, street kids playing after curfew, the flicker in a stall window\u2014never made it home. Labs lose them, or someone at customs \u2018reviews\u2019 my negatives.",
      "I keep backups, handwritten notes about every shot, because you never know what\u2019ll get wiped from the system next. Analog\u2019s slow, risky, and yeah\u2014it\u2019s the only honest record left."

      "Had a scare last week: checkpoint scanned my band twice, all because my walk wasn\u2019t 'optimized' for the crowd.",
      "People are on edge. I catch them ducking cameras, not just mine\u2014everyone\u2019s thinking about score drops.",

      "Absolutely\u2014there's something honest about film, especially now, with the whole system shaking from that portal.",
      "Last time I was out, the route home changed mid-walk. Claimed it was for 'optimization,' but I know it\u2019s the BCI pulsing after Halden\u2019s scandal.",
      "I see more folks hiding from cameras, even regulars. One guy quietly slipped me a note\u2014'Don\u2019t shoot the mirrors.' Guess he heard about that smart mirror incident I covered.",

      "Definitely. Analog\u2019s how I keep myself honest, even if the system hates it\u2014Dad was BCI, used to warn me about traceable routines.",
      "With the portal rollout, checkpoints flagged my supply run\u2014lost two canisters when I got rerouted. Said my 'pattern' was off. That was new since Halden\u2019s death.",
      "Now, half my shooting is dodging guidance bots or ducking drones. They\u2019re programmed to track what lens I use, or at least log where I linger. Creepy, right?",
      "What gets me is the quiet; street scenes feel rehearsed. I see folks glance at camera domes and change their faces. That haunting vibe\u2014like everyone\u2019s waiting for the \u2018wrong\u2019 moment to vanish from the feed.",
      "I keep backup prints hidden in a coffee tin, pass coded contact sheets to friends who still trust me. You\u2019d be surprised what the system misses, if you\u2019re old-school enough.",
      "If I ever stop, it\u2019ll be because the city chokes out every last speck of film. Until then, I\u2019ll keep chasing ghosts\u2014real and digital."
