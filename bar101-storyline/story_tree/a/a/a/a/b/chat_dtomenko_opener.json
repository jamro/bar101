      "Steady as I can be. I stick to my routines outside work.",
      "Fly drones for fun, that's about it. Keeps me busy, clears my head.",
      "Nothing complicated. Just loops around some old warehouses.",

      "I'm alright, thanks. I mostly keep to myself after hours.",
      "Fly FPV drones\u2014nothing fancy, just little quadcopters you steer by video feed.",
      "I usually head to abandoned lots outside the busy sectors.",
      "Lately, signal interference got weird. I guess that BCI mess is to blame.",
      "I just try not to get in the way and bring mine home before curfew."

      "Yeah, I'm steady enough. Honestly, the thing that keeps me sane is flying drones\u2014FPV, freestyle.",
      "I go out to the old depot most weeks, just throw on the goggles and let muscle memory take over.",
      "Last weekend the signal got jumpy\u2014city\u2019s network was all over the place after that Halden hologram incident.",
      "Had to stick to analog channels; not as clear, but it\u2019s better than nothing when the official grid crashes.",
      "It\u2019s quiet out there. Makes it easy to breathe, even when the city isn\u2019t."

    [
      "Mostly steady. If it weren\u2019t for my drone flights, I\u2019d lose it\u2014freestyle FPV is how I disconnect.",
      "Took the quad out to an old industrial stretch after the latest city broadcast\u2014figured nobody would care with everyone glued to those public screens.",
      "Mid-flight, the signal got spiky\u2014looked like new BCI controls were boosting perimeter scans. My feed glitched, apps went offline, and my usual routes felt riskier than usual.",
      "I switched to analog just for the rush\u2014flying blind, dodging patrols. Honestly, it\u2019s cleaner than a therapist\u2019s office.",
      "People think it\u2019s about tech, but it\u2019s about having five minutes where I call the shots and nobody\u2019s watching\u2014at least, not quite."

    [
      "I\u2019m steady as long as I get my flying hours in. FPV drones\u2014full manual, old-school goggles, nothing automated.",
      "I was out last week, right after the new Halden broadcast\u2014city\u2019s pulse was thumping, those BCI algorithms were out of phase, patrols extra twitchy.",
      "Almost got flagged\u2014my drone\u2019s telemetry picked up signature checks that don\u2019t usually sweep that far out. I had to scrub my logs afterward, splice two flights together just to keep my own data clean.",
      "It\u2019s been harder since my brother disappeared during an audit. Flying\u2019s the only time I don\u2019t run checks every ten seconds. Out there, even when signal\u2019s glitched and the apps collapse, I can forget.",
      "That hour above the ruins\u2014static in my ears, city lights cut by bandwidth flakes\u2014it\u2019s like ghosting the whole system for a breath. That\u2019s all I want from it sometimes."

      "Yeah. Managed one clean loop last night.",
      "Mostly just stuck to the edge, didn\u2019t linger.",
      "There\u2019s more drone noise lately\u2014harder to get clear air.",
      "Signals are jumpier since the broadcast, but I adapt.",
      "Anyway, only flew short\u2014risk isn\u2019t worth it now."

      "Routes are fine if you know when to go.",
      "Had some interference after those citywide messages though.",
      "Patrol patterns changed, saw more security hardware out.",
      "Getting trickier, but the old analog failsafes still work.",

      "Pretty clean, all things considered. Pushed a few routes near the depot last week.",
      "Signal got weird though\u2014some frequency spikes right after those Halden projectors started showing up.",
      "Guess the system\u2019s recalibrating; saw new no-fly alerts pop mid-flight.",
      "Had to drop to analog to keep video.",
      "Feels like the drones are twitchier, but that\u2019s half the fun now."

    [
      "They\u2019re still clean if you watch the BCI sectors\u2014lots of jumpy patrols since Halden\u2019s message.",
      "Last run, my digital channel almost locked out mid-route. Haven\u2019t seen interference like that before the broadcasts.",
      "Lost sync, but muscle memory kept it stable; switched to analog and finished the circuit underground.",
      "Makes me wonder how much the system tracks us for hobbies, not just work.",
      "Honestly, flying\u2019s the only time I forget about the background threat."
    ],
    [
      "Yeah, still clean enough for now\u2014if you map out new patrol schedules every week. The city\u2019s changed so much since those Halden holograms.",
      "Signals are way messier. Not just routine drone sweeps\u2014saw on my logs that new BCI patches are probing for unregistered signals. Could be random, but this never happened before Halden died.",
      "Last week, my quad\u2019s video froze twice. Had to triple-check for firmware tags\u2014if they flag you, it gets personal fast.",
      "Feels like they don\u2019t know who to trust, so nobody risks much anymore. Wild how fast a hobby can turn risky. Used to be my whole week\u2019s relief from everything; now it feels like threading a needle.",
      "Sometimes I re-fly old routes from before the BCI went full predictive. Just muscle memory and static now\u2014keeps me grounded."
