      "You could say that. I\u2019ve kept busy most of the evening\u2014got lost fixing a stubborn jam on a battered Halberg portable. I collect and restore typewriters, real ones\u2014iron, springs, no feedback prompts.",
      "It\u2019s a habit from days before the BCI took over, before everything was monitored and predicted. Writing by hand, or even by key, feels more honest to me than any screen.",
      "When the assistants started glitching and folks in my block swapped compliance manuals, it only reinforced it: analog is clarity, everything else is just guided static.",

      "Once, I even helped a Council member draft letters this way\u2014an old protocol for messages too sensitive for the system. That habit never left me, especially now."
