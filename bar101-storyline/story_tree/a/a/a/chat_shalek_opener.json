      "Yes, I did. Been dodging more than just noise, if I\u2019m honest. I collect old political books, banned ones mostly. Thought I'd spend last night annotating a new piece, but these guidance systems make every hour unpredictable. You never know when they\u2019ll call something contraband."

      "I made it past the noise\u2014barely. I like to unwind by restoring banned political literature. There\u2019s a certain pleasure in piecing together what\u2019s been lost or deemed forbidden. The recent chaos with the assistants? It made cataloguing my latest acquisition feel more like a covert operation than a hobby."

      "The noise almost kept me away, but I needed a break from it all. I collect and restore banned political books\u2014yes, the real ones, not the council-approved reprints. Yesterday, the guidance assistants kept glitching, so I spent hours cross-checking my collection with the newest forbidden lists. Strange how something once so methodical feels dangerous again."

      "Made it, though the clamor these days is as much inside as outside. I\u2019ve spent years quietly collecting and restoring banned political literature, ever since I realized half our nation\u2019s memory lived between torn covers. Last night, I finished annotating a rare manifesto, but with assistants giving conflicting compliance rules, I had to print out the blacklist and catalogue by candlelight. It\u2019s absurd\u2014my hobby, once a silent rebellion, suddenly feels relevant again. Makes you wonder if history is always waiting for the right kind of chaos to make itself heard."

      "Feels surreal\u2014at this point, collecting banned books isn\u2019t nostalgia. It\u2019s the last honest thing I know how to do."
