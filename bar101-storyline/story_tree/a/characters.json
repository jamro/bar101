Feeling the public's growing distrust, she started discreetly consulting colleagues about potential system flaws during lunch breaks, a change from her usual solitary routine.

Without automated diagnostics, Lenart recalibrated his strategy, opting for manual assessments, abandoning reliance on the now-faltering system. Though he adapted, implementing rote checklists, the inefficiencies extended his workday, forcing him to decline on-the-spot requests. This new dynamic left Lenart reassessing his role and dependency on a system that he once trusted implicitly.",
