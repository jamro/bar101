As the unified protests grew, roads were frequently blocked, delaying his commute to core facilities. On one specific occasion, while en route to fix a critical data mismatch in a district nearly brought to a standstill, Lenart faced rerouted paths, forcing longer detours. This increase in travel time meant he completed fewer contracts, intensifying his frustration over failing systems.

However, the growing need for clarity and system stability lingered, pushing Lenart to question the infrastructure he once believed in.",
