      "Was out with my 35mm camera, trying to get some street shots.",

      "The city\u2019s felt off since Halden\u2019s announcement, you know? Makes every snapshot count.",
      "Film\u2019s finicky. Missed a whole roll because one of the drop boxes jammed from a system fault.",

      "Barely, but that\u2019s part of the game. Took my Nikon out\u201435mm, actual film. Some people think I\u2019m crazy for sticking with it.",
      "Been chasing those raw, unfiltered street moments all evening. The city\u2019s jumpy since the BCI started glitching after Halden\u2019s death.",
      "My favorite drop spot for film refused to open\u2014tech acting up everywhere. Had to improvise, find a hand who would help.",
      "Truth is, with everything so watched and mediated, real moments are rare. Film feels like the only honest witness left.",

      "One piece, just barely. Honestly, I risked more for a good shot than for my reports tonight.",
      "I brought my analog camera\u2014and not just for nostalgia. My father was BCI when I was a kid. He always said, 'The system leaves footprints, but so do we.' That\u2019s why I use film. It\u2019s harder to erase.",
      "Tonight the city was different\u2014crowds tense, surveillance drones skating lower than usual. Even Bar 101\u2019s drop box glitched out after Halden. Had to call in a favor for something that should\u2019ve been simple.",
      "Most folks think I shoot for state media, but my real work is these off-the-record rolls. System\u2019s breaking cover, so people reveal themselves\u2014in a glance, a hesitation. Makes every shutter click heavier.",
      "Used to think you could just tell the truth. Now, you have to sneak up and steal it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m out there, with film\u2014no edits, no algorithm to filter what you see. Just me, the city, and what\u2019s left when the network fails."

      "Every street shot is a gamble\u2014drones hovering low, access points failing. The city\u2019s got this electric nervousness, like it\u2019s off-script for once.",
      "Last Friday my entire backup stash nearly got locked out because Halden\u2019s override credentials were missing. I nearly lost a week\u2019s work to a system prompt.",

      "I don\u2019t upload much through official channels. Encryption, hard copies, I trust my own hands more than any terminal these days."
