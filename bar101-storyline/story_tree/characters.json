  "olintz": "Marek Halden's death left a significant void within the Central Oversight Directorate, disrupting Oksana Lintz's daily routine as system inconsistencies surged. Immediately, Oksana's task of flagging behavioral patterns became erratic, with unpredictable scores complicating her workflow. The removal of Halden's access credentials triggered malfunctions in BCI subsystems, complicating her ability to respond to flagged anomalies efficiently. Confusion settled over her as she noticed the persistence of scoring irregularities that she couldn't correct. Unease mingled with her growing disillusionment, prompting her to spend isolated evenings analyzing data trends at home. Despite her attempts to adapt, unresolved issues continued to strain her professional focus.",
  "npetrak": "Following Marek Halden's untimely demise and the subsequent system failures, Nikola Petrak's day began with unfamiliar disruptions. On his routine morning walk to the local store, he encountered unexpected delays as transport services experienced widespread scoring irregularities due to the system's fallback mode. The usually short trip stretched into a bewildering two-hour ordeal. This external bafflement sparked a rare reflection on his past Council service, where such inefficiencies were meticulously avoided. He resolved to skim through his old notes once he returned home, searching for insights into the unfolding chaos. The locked briefcase, untouched for years, suddenly felt relevant.",
  "dtomenko": "Daria noticed irregularities in the wristband data stream three days after Halden's muted death, as the BCI subsystems began to falter. Her routine checks revealed inconsistent health indicators, often reverting without explanation, leading to her devoting excessive hours to manual corrections. The burden of ensuring accurate updates without proper guidance intensified her focus on perfecting her unofficial data erasure skills. Concerned about personal safety and professional exposure due to the BCI's unpredictability, she discreetly expanded her network, seeking allies among those affected by the system's lapses. This cautious maneuvering ensured her operational safety but heightened her anxiety and vigilance.",
  "lkova": "Following Marek Halden's unexplained death and ensuing system failures, Lenart Kova found his day disrupted when a routine maintenance task in Tower 9 led to unexpected complications. Systems requiring Halden\u2019s exclusive credentials were inaccessible, forcing Lenart to reroute and pause crucial updates on essential infrastructure. Unable to access the automated diagnostics he relied on, he spent hours manually troubleshooting, delaying other commitments. This operational halt exposed Lenart to clients' frustrations and complaints, highlighting his reliance on a once-dependable system. Adapting, he began logging and prioritizing issues manually, but the inefficiencies lingered, prompting him to rethink his maintenance strategies.",
  "shalek": "Following Marek Halden's death, Sven Halek found himself embroiled in a sudden shift within the Council. With no clear authority, factions descended into disarray. Amid the confusion, Sven noticed his strategic messaging files now lacked a defined reader, challenging his role. While preparing a statement to calm public uncertainty, the fallout from Halden's exclusive access issues caused significant delays, affecting BCI subsystems' functionality. This forced Sven to adapt quickly, rewriting speeches almost daily as system malfunctions changed the narrative. Despite the routine, a sense of unease lingered as he questioned the stability of the structures he once promoted.",
  "rmiskovic": "The announcement of Marek Halden's death and the subsequent system failures altered Rada Miskovic's routine considerably. The malfunctions in the BCI subsystems caused widespread reporting delays, affecting Rada's ability to deliver timely stories. She found herself navigating sudden ambiguities in news briefs, with fragmented data disrupting her streamlined workflows. Faced with unclear directives from an unresponsive Council, Rada sensed a growing uncertainty in her state's usual precision. During this period, she spent longer hours at Bar 101, sifting through conversations and whispers, hoping to piece together unseen narratives. The lingering tension prompted her to archive more unedited footage than usual."
