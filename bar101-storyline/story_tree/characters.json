  "olintz": "After Marek Halden\u2019s unannounced absence from the internal audit, Oksana arrived to find her access to real-time behavioral data sporadically failing throughout her shift. By mid-morning, automated alerts that she relied on required manual validation, causing her to rerun several analyses. When several flagged cases could not be retrieved, she skipped lunch to reconcile mismatched records with another analyst by phone. The realization that unreliable scores could block residents from essential services made her question the fairness of the system. That evening, she left work later than usual, hesitating before swiping into her apartment block\u2019s entry.",
  "npetrak": "After the public announcement of Halden\u2019s death and the subsequent system failures affecting city services, Nikola found his routine trip to the local medical center delayed by irregular appointment processing and longer queue times. The front desk staff could not access his records, requiring Nikola to produce physical identification and answer security questions for the first time in months. Later that day, he noticed his usual transit route had been rerouted without warning, forcing him to take a longer path home. These disruptions led Nikola to check the contents of his locked briefcase again, verifying that the documents remained secure.",
  "dtomenko": "After news spread that Marek Halden was found dead and no replacement was named, Daria arrived at her lab to find core access terminals locked and update scripts delayed by hours. When routine maintenance for citizen wristbands failed due to system errors, she spent her shift manually inputting code and fielding confused requests from fellow technicians worried about potential compliance flags. Instead of her usual quiet routine, Daria had to justify every data alteration to a rotating committee. She now double-checks every maintenance report for anomalies, careful not to trigger new alerts, and quietly updates contact lists for trusted allies.",
  "lkova": "After Marek Halden\u2019s death is quietly announced, Lenart arrives at a client\u2019s building to find elevators stalled and entry logs inaccessible, delaying routine repairs. Later that day, the building manager asks him to manually verify residents\u2019 access, a task usually handled by automated systems. Unable to resolve a data mismatch on his portable terminal, Lenart documents the issue and leaves without payment, told that billing can\u2019t process until system scoring recovers. Instead of moving on to his next job, he spends hours making calls and cross-referencing paper records\u2014an improvised solution that leaves several scheduled clients waiting and erodes their trust.",
  "shalek": "After Marek Halden\u2019s unaddressed absence triggered system malfunctions, Sven found his direct access to speech archives delayed by hours, disrupting his nightly policy drafting routine. When the official announcement of Halden\u2019s death provided no replacement or clear timeline, Sven adjusted by visiting Bar 101 hours earlier than usual, bringing both his secure notebook and a printed list of leaders\u2019 last approved statements. He paused twice to recheck authorization codes before transmitting updates, wary that any language misstep might trigger unexplained service denials. That evening, he skipped a planned call with a Council aide, uncertain which directives would remain valid overnight.",
  "rmiskovic": "After the official announcement of Marek Halden\u2019s death, Rada found her newsroom assignment list unexpectedly blank, forcing her to wait in the staff lounge for hours as editors argued behind closed doors. Later, while preparing a broadcast summary, she noticed the BCI terminal in her office displayed irregular access warnings and denied uploads of several raw video segments without explanation. That evening, concerned about missing coverage and unexplained technical barriers, she used backup recording devices at Bar 101 and encrypted her files offsite, bypassing the standard channel. Since then, she checks every system prompt twice and keeps hard copies of every report."
