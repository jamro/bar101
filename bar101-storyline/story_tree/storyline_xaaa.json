He lives in a controlled-access residential complex for ex-officers and participates in quarterly closed-door briefings as part of a \u201creserve strategy cohort\u201d \u2014 an informal circle of former officials consulted in times of transition. Miro is divorced, childless, and keeps a small collection of wartime correspondence in his study. While he holds no formal office, he is respected by active-duty officers and still receives encrypted memos marked 'for insight only.'",
    "communication": "Uses sharp, minimal sentences \u2014 the way someone trained to give orders would. He says little, but every word carries weight."
