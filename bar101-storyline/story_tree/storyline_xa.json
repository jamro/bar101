    "details": "Karina is a licensed journalist affiliated with Stenogram, a semi-independent media outlet specializing in administrative transparency and civic processes. She holds dual degrees in investigative journalism and legal systems, and her early reporting on land-use corruption earned her quiet citations in internal policy reviews. Though she avoids overt political posturing, her work is frequently used by reformist blocs within the Civic Audit Network as supporting evidence in committee reviews. She has informal access to mid-ranking bureaucrats and policy editors, and she\u2019s rumored to have once ghostwritten a speech for a Council sub-chair. Karina is single, keeps meticulous notebooks, and spends her weekends in community libraries reviewing physical archives.",
