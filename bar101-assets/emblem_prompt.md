Draw a new illustration by seamlessly integrating the [PRODUCT] into the emblem background. The product should be positioned prominently and resized proportionally to fit harmoniously within the emblem’s layout. Adapt the product’s color palette, lighting, and shading to match the vintage texture and sepia tones of the emblem, as if it were originally designed to belong there. Preserve the emblem’s original black background and decorative elements, and ensure the final composition maintains a square aspect ratio with a polished, unified visual style.
