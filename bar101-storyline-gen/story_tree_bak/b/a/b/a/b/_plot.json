  "outcome": "In response to public outrage and unresolved grief, the Council announces a citywide tribunal where any citizen\u2014active or vanished\u2014can testify to BCI injustices. The process uncovers not just the stories of disappeared citizens, but exposes deep-seated betrayals and secret protocols within Council ranks. Districts erupt with raw, sometimes chaotic debates as forgotten neighborhood feuds and hidden loyalties resurface. The tribunal splits both citizens and the Council itself, forcing new alliances and moral confrontations that threaten to destabilize Stenograd's social fabric.",
