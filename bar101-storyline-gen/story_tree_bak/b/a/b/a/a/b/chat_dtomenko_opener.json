      "Normally, it\u2019s just empty and quiet, barely anyone around.",
      "Since the city screens went wild, everyone\u2019s out\u2014painting, scanning, leaving those weird coded signs.",
      "Flew last weekend, but had to cut it short. Too visible, too many people watching.",

      "Makes me think someone\u2019s rerouting comms just to stay off Council scripts.",

      "I mess with custom FPV drones\u2014freestyle flights, signal-mapping, mostly after midnight.",
      "It\u2019s more than a hobby. I started after my brother vanished, scanning dead zones for anomalies.",
      "Before all the protest faces and broadcast hacks, I felt invisible out there.",
      "Now people are following the vanished, tagging buildings, running their own mesh networks.",
      "Last week, crowds steered my drone with hand signals like some secret game.",
      "Patrols started sweeping my favorite fly zone\u2014didn\u2019t even care before.",
      "Kind of funny, Council spent years automating trust, now it\u2019s everyone watching everyone.",
      "Half the city\u2019s plugged in, but nobody really sees what\u2019s right in front of them."

      "Definitely. New firmware, and tuned the camera for night work.",

      "Once, a vanished friend\u2019s tag showed up right beneath my flight path.",
      "I recorded it, but won\u2019t upload\u2014system\u2019s tracking everything after that Lenart broadcast.",
      "Had to bail before the patrols pinned down frequencies.",
