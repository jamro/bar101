  "dilemma": "Daria must decide whether to activate Halden\u2019s encrypted legacy program, restoring a guided form of decentralized order, or to override it, unleashing a live public vote that hands real power to the people. Both actions will set Stenograd on irreversibly different paths.",
  "reason": "The decision is crushing because each option could save or doom the city\u2014Halden's plan promises order through local leadership, while raw citizen voting risks chaos but real freedom. Daria\u2019s authority over the health network firmware gives her rare power to tip the balance, but the burden is immense. Conversations with Alex, the bartender, echo in her mind, stirring hopes of a city that listens to its people, but also fears of what happens without any guardrails.",
