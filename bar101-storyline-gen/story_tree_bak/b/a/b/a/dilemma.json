  "dilemma": "Sven Halek must decide whether to covertly amplify the vanished citizens\u2019 messages, allowing this underground movement to blossom into a citywide force for change, or to redirect public outrage into a Council-led public tribunal, promising justice and accountability within official channels. Both paths cannot coexist: one cements hidden networks, the other strikes for institutional reform.",
  "reason": "Sven is torn between his love of disruptive change and his strategist\u2019s fear that chaos will consume Stenograd unless carefully guided.
