  "outcome": "Three days after the mass demonstrations, a hidden notebook of Halden's is discovered by Daria, containing a humane, forgiving governance model and the cryptic line: 'Spirals are for climbing out.' The Council cautiously implements this model. Communities embrace open self-correction and amnesty for past BCI violations, leading to a rare period of unity. But soon, unsettling evidence surfaces showing the spiral plan may have been another layer of Halden\u2019s elaborate test for Stenograd. The city must decide whether to trust Halden\u2019s final vision, or demand something new entirely.",
