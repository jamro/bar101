  "trigger_event": "Following the public surfacing of BCI onboarding archives, both the 'invisibles' and a wave of teacher-led civic assemblies compete for influence over Stenograd's future. Sven Halek finds himself courted by both camps\u2014one pleading for his access to critical city infrastructure, the other for his endorsement to open the airwaves to grassroots debate.",
  "dilemma": "Sven must decide: directly empower the 'invisibles' with the system access they need to pressure the Council for true reform, or use his Council-level communications authority to champion the newly awakened public assemblies, handing them control over the next chapter of city governance.",
  "reason": "Sven is torn between the seductive certainty of system control, championed by those who have been erased and exiled from the city\u2019s official life, and the messy, unpredictable energy of open civic debate. His conversations with Alex have made him question whether change is ever truly safe\u2014or only real when it\u2019s risky and seen by all.",
  "choice_a": "Secretly transmit override credentials to the 'invisibles,' enabling them to coordinate city infrastructure and force the Council into negotiating reforms.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Change is only possible when those who know the system's flaws control its levers.",
    "Public debate without power is theater; real influence flows through hidden channels.",
    "Erased citizens, not current leaders, best understand how to construct a new order."
  ],
  "choice_b": "Use official communication channels to amplify teacher-led public forums, legitimizing their assemblies and encouraging mass participation in decisions about the city\u2019s future.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Lasting legitimacy can\u2019t be won in shadow\u2014only in the open.",
    "Public assemblies, though chaotic, are the first breath of real democracy.",
    "Shared reckoning with the past is the only way forward for a divided city."
