  "trigger_event": "After rumors about Halden\u2019s journal ignite calls for truth, Rada receives a trove of old BCI onboarding recordings along with urgent messages: one group begs her to air them citywide, another pleads for secrecy, seeing danger in public reckoning. The same night, behind the bar\u2019s hush, she debates her power\u2014and which secret to reveal.",
  "dilemma": "Should Rada broadcast the BCI onboarding archives to confront the city with its hidden past, or secretly hand them to Innovators to create a digital Halden, trusting him to guide Stenograd through the storm?",
  "reason": "Rada knows either action will permanently change the city: revealing the footage risks igniting trauma and blame, while aiding the Innovators could entrench machine rule and bury human error. Her devotion to the truth is tested by her fear that truth alone might fracture Stenograd beyond repair.",
  "choice_a": "Broadcast the onboarding archives across Stenograd, making everyone confront their own recorded past and forcing a public reckoning.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Collective memory is the foundation of true community healing.",
    "Only by facing truth together can Stenograd move forward.",
    "Manipulation thrives in darkness\u2014sunlight is the remedy."
  ],
  "choice_b": "Hand over the onboarding archives in secret to rogue Innovators, letting them use Halden\u2019s past to resurrect him as an AI and steer the city through uncertainty.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Guidance is needed to avoid chaos\u2014even an artificial voice can unite the frightened.",
    "Protecting the city from mass panic is more important than airing old wounds.",
    "Sometimes shielding people from truth is the only way to prevent disaster."
