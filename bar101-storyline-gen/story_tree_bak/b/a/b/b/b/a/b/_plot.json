  "outcome": "With the BCI and Halden-Index silent, Directorate loyalists enact a plan to restore order through force. They seize old surveillance routines, manipulate compliance patrols, and round up dissenters. Innovator engineers and citizens resist, using sabotage tactics learned from the previously invisible population. After three weeks of escalating conflict, public evidence reveals Directorate's power play was built on forged data and backdoor manipulation, overturning attempts at authoritarian revival and igniting a city-wide call for direct democracy.",
