  "trigger_event": "The aftermath of Halden\u2019s death and the reappearance of invisible citizens push the BCI to a breaking point, causing random, public-facing disruptions in service and assignment. The Council cannot restore trust\u2014everyone looks to Sven Halek for a bold solution.",
  "dilemma": "Should Sven Halek call for a hard clampdown\u2014restoring lost order through intense verification and force\u2014or risk everything by suspending the BCI, trusting citizens to manage themselves and reshaping the city's future from the ground up? Both paths carry personal and civic peril.",
  "reason": "Sven Halek is torn: a clampdown would deepen the city\u2019s fear but may restore order, while letting citizens run things risks chaos but could unlock renewal. Recent conversations with Alex, the bartender, have forced him to confront the cost of both distrust and hope in people.",
  "choice_a": "Authorize a forceful return to algorithmic control with biometric/manual checks, lockdowns, and a campaign to root out BCI manipulation\u2014regardless of public outcry.",

  "choice_b": "Propose a public suspension of BCI scores, placing trusted locals in charge of essential services for one week. Let citizens rediscover self-organization and prove their ability to adapt.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Genuine renewal comes from trust, not force.",
    "People rise to the challenge if given responsibility.",
