  "trigger_event": "Citywide assemblies and growing unrest paralyze Stenograd. Lenart receives an urgent alert: core infrastructure is failing, requiring immediate action to either fully sever or quietly restore BCI backups. He recalls a late-night conversation with Alex, the bartender, about the real weight of control versus freedom.",
  "dilemma": "Lenart must choose whether to cut the city\u2019s automated core, handing all control to citizen assemblies despite the risk of chaos, or secretly reconnect backup systems and let the BCI start guiding services again, ensuring stability but reviving algorithmic influence.",
  "reason": "Both choices carry risks to those Lenart cares about: severing the core may bring disorder and suffering, but restoring BCI means risking a return to secret control. His maintenance access and technical skills make him the only one positioned to make this irreversible decision.",
  "choice_a": "Sever the BCI connection, giving full power to citizen assemblies and plunging the city into self-rule without algorithmic interference.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Personal freedom is worth the cost of uncertainty.",
    "Real justice can only come from direct, human negotiation.",
    "Centralized algorithms breed mistrust and dependency."

  "choice_b": "Quietly restore backup BCI protocols, allowing services to stabilize\u2014with the risk that centralized influence will subtly return.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Dependable infrastructure keeps people safe above all.",
    "Sudden collapse serves no one, even if it means ceding some freedom.",
    "Order can be quietly preserved, even as the public debates bigger changes."
