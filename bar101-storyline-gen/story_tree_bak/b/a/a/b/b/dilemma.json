  "trigger_event": "The erased citizens seize the city\u2019s broadcast networks, sharing their stories of disappearance and implicating Halden\u2019s secret orders. The whole city listens\u2014and waits for a Council response.",
  "dilemma": "Nikola Petrak must decide whether to open the Council\u2019s vault of secret files for public tribunals, allowing erased citizens a voice and risking even greater scandal, or to authorize the Directorate\u2019s purge of the BCI\u2019s tainted roots, aiming for fast, silent stability but erasing any chance for truth and reconciliation.",
  "reason": "Nikola is tormented by recent soul-searching conversations over drinks with Alex, the bartender, who pressed him to consider the city\u2019s hunger for truth versus its craving for order. His authority as keeper of Council records and emergency procedures gives him the unique power to tip Stenograd toward open justice or a closed reset, but either path will harm people he cares about.",
  "choice_a": "Permit the public opening of Council archives and support citywide restoration tribunals, letting erased citizens testify and faults surface.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Truth\u2014even with risks\u2014restores hope.",
    "Legitimacy grows out of visible, collective reckoning.",
    "Secrecy breeds more fracture than order."
  ],
  "choice_b": "Sign off on the Directorate\u2019s emergency reset, authorizing the purge of BCI code tied to Halden and reverting to old protocols for fast, enforced stability.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Order is the only true security.",
    "A quick cut cures deeper rot.",
    "Public spectacle will only create new wounds."
