  "outcome": "Three days after the partition leaks, 'disappeared' citizens return to Stenograd, holding hidden BCI codes and stories of secret detention. Their testimonies expose factional abuses and hidden truths about Halden\u2019s final days. As they reintegrate, citywide councils must decide whether to trust the returnees or treat them as threats, escalating the crisis. The chapter climaxes with the revelation that their codes can either permanently unify or irreversibly fragment the BCI.",
