      "Day like this, I focus on my typewriter collection. Keeps my hands occupied. Power\u2019s unreliable since those resource shifts in the free zones. Had to finish a ribbon swap by candlelight last night. Still, nothing beats that old mechanical click. Reminds me how things used to be."

      "Truth is, I restore old typewriters. Did last night, during that blackout. Free zone activity\u2019s messing with the power again, nearly jammed the carriage blind. Wrote a note by candlelight, just like in my youth. That click of keys, steady in chaos, gives a sense of order. Analog machines\u2014harder to subvert than systems these days."

      "You know, typewriters are my escape. Used to manage council memos, now it\u2019s personal letters only. Last blackout caught me halfway through cleaning an Underwood. New free zone resource hacks, power flickering all across our block. Feels like the old world\u2014paper, ink, candlelight. Wrote a neighbor a note, slid it under their door. In times like these, analog trust is worth more than any score or smart terminal. Sometimes I wonder if folks now understand why I cherish these machines."
