      "Been more people volunteering out there, since the BCI started tracking it.",
      "Had to shift flight paths around pop-up food drops.",
      "It\u2019s noisy, but\u2026 kind of energizing lately.",

      "Last week, I helped a crew map med supply routes after dark. They pooled leftover transmitters, improvised mesh signals.",
      "Band logged everything. Got my first big BCI score bump in months \u2014 for just flying patterns, helping people.",
      "Honestly, feels surreal. I never trusted the system to reward anything real.",
      "If Marek saw this, he\u2019d probably say it was a glitch \u2014 or a loophole.",
