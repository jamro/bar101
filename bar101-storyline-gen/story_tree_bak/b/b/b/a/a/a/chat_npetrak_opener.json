      "It\u2019s often quiet when I\u2019m here, which I prefer. My hobby is restoring typewriters\u2014Hermes, Underwood, you name it. Last week, the free zone council held a truth assembly right outside my window. Crowds argued, details spilled\u2014hard to focus on fine springs and dusty keys. Sometimes the world seeps in, even into small repairs."

      "Used to be quieter, before the assemblies took over the streets. I\u2019ve spent years restoring old typewriters\u2014Hermes 3000 is my favorite for the carriage design. Sometimes I draft memories on paper, keep journals\u2014habit from before BCI took hold. Last Thursday, the assembly outside broke my routine; I documented voices and arguments as much as machine repairs. These days, both seem equally fragile\u2014old metal and honest testimony. It\u2019s strange how hobbies blur with history lately."
