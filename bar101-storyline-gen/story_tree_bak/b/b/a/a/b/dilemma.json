  "trigger_event": "Citywide outrage and growing instability force the Council to request an urgent recommendation from Oksana on either halting the malfunctioning BCI system for a trial period or authorizing an immediate forced reset.",
  "dilemma": "Oksana must decide whether to recommend a citywide suspension of the BCI system to allow communities to self-organize and build trust, or to support a hardline, immediate reinstatement of BCI control with accompanying crackdowns on dissent.",
  "reason": "Oksana is deeply torn because suspending the BCI could allow dangerous chaos but might help citizens regain real trust\u2014while restarting it forcefully could bring harsh order, yet further erode the city's spirit and foster lasting resentment. Her unusual access and low BCI score add personal risk, and her recent, frank conversations with Alex the bartender haunt her\u2014do people truly need a system, or could they find their own way?",
  "choice_a": "Advise a three-week suspension of the BCI, freezing all scores and compliance checkpoints to allow neighborhoods to self-organize and rely on human cooperation.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Real trust can\u2019t be programmed\u2014people need space to rediscover it.",
    "Temporary disorder is less dangerous than ongoing resentment and fear.",
    "Lasting order depends on legitimacy, not just compliance."
  ],
  "choice_b": "Advise the immediate restoration of BCI control, activating emergency protocols and authorizing detentions, broadcast propaganda, and a crackdown on public unrest.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Order must be enforced, even against public will, to avoid irreversible damage.",
    "People aren\u2019t ready to cooperate without guidance and consequences.",
    "Short-term security is worth civil freedoms if stability is threatened."
