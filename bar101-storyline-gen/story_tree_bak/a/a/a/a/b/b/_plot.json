  "title": "Punitive Reset",
  "outcome": "With BCI failures isolating neighborhoods, the Directorate seizes its chance to impose a 'Harmony Reset.' Power, transport, and BCI privileges are granted only to districts with high compliance scores, freezing out Halden Zones and protest hubs. Once-privileged neighborhoods now face sudden service loss, while displaced residents flood more lenient districts, straining resources. Public outrage grows as citizens realize the system\u2019s fallback logic is disproportionately punitive. The Council faces internal revolt as Harmonists and Innovators push back against security-first policies.",
