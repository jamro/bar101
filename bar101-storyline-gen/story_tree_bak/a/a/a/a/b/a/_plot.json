  "title": "False Amnesty Cycle",
  "outcome": "The Council, facing mounting unrest and the spread of independent support networks, decrees a citywide amnesty for all previous BCI offenses. For two weeks, thousands apply for record \u201cclearing.\u201d Initially, hope and gratitude rise, but it soon emerges that for each person cleared, someone else is quietly re-flagged to maintain system quotas. The old pattern of selective \u201camnesty\u201d seen in earlier pilot programs reemerges. Disillusionment returns as activist groups expose this scheme and unrest simmers anew.",
