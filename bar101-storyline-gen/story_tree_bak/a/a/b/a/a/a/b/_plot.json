  "title": "Trial By Assembly",
  "outcome": "Empowered by the revelation of disappearances and system abuses, citizen panels demand accountability. Within days, mass public tribunals begin across Stenograd, compelling Council members, Harmonists, Innovators, and Directorate officials to answer for BCI\u2019s failures. Testimony from 'invisible citizens' and whistleblowers redraws the city\u2019s moral map, dividing the public between forgiveness and fury. As old decisions are relitigated, powerful alliances fracture, and new collective visions for justice surface, forever transforming the city\u2019s understanding of order, history, and leadership.",
