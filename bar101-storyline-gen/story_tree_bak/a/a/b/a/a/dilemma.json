  "trigger_event": "Nikola is handed a sealed paper archive, the only complete record of sanctioned BCI purges and disappearances, as the public reels from recent score reversals and demands answers. Both reformist and hardline Council members pressure him to choose a side: expose the truth, or protect what\u2019s left of government authority.",
  "dilemma": "Should I release the sealed archive of disappearances and sanctioned purges, knowing it will rip open the Council\u2019s secrets and inflame public outrage, or destroy it to protect what little order remains \u2014 even if it means burying the truth?",
  "reason": "Nikola fears that exposing the truth will plunge the city further into chaos, yet suppressing it will make him complicit in cover-ups and betray his own code. The recent candid talks with Alex, the bartender, have made him question whether peace without justice is truly peace at all.",
  "choice_a": "Release the sealed archive to citizen groups, revealing the truth behind disappearances and igniting a public reckoning.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Truth is necessary for genuine reconciliation and stability.",
    "The people deserve to know what was done in their name.",
    "Restoring trust requires painful transparency, not silence."
  ],
  "choice_b": "Destroy the archive, quietly handing over what remains to the Directorate and letting the past stay buried to preserve a fragile peace.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Civic order is more important than painful justice during crisis.",
    "The city cannot withstand another tremor of outrage.",
    "Some truths are too dangerous to reveal."
