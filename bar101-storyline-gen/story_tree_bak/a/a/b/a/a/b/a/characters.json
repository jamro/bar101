    "chapter": "After deciding to release Halden\u2019s full confession and narrative logs, Oksana worked with Rada to securely broadcast the files citywide. Early that morning, she bypassed her remaining system restrictions, uploaded the decrypted archive, and circulated a concise summary detailing the BCI\u2019s original design and Halden\u2019s orchestrated death. The immediate disclosure led the city to denounce the Council and abandon BCI authority. Oksana observed her building\u2019s atmosphere change: neighbors openly referenced the confession, forming small groups to debate solutions. Anxious but methodical, Oksana deleted personal analysis files and surrendered her audit credentials to the impromptu citizen forum, accepting public review of her past work. Within hours, city systems revoked her BCI status, returning her access to neutral standing as all scores were voided. Oksana\u2019s decision made her a clear catalyst\u2014her choice directly prompted open forums and marked the end of Stenograd\u2019s algorithmic governance. BCI score set to 0.",

    "chapter": "After the resignation of the Council and the abandonment of BCI controls, Nikola faced the abrupt disappearance of all familiar protocols. That morning, he found the building access system deactivated and resident score lists torn down. Formerly ostracized neighbors now moved freely in shared spaces, ignoring previous divisions. In the afternoon, Nikola encountered an impromptu forum in the courtyard where residents openly reviewed past block management decisions. When approached to attend, he declined, choosing instead to retrieve his hidden documents under the cover of reduced surveillance. Without enforced score checks, he hesitated to participate in the new committees, preferring to observe and limit contact. Nikola\u2019s old risk markers became irrelevant, but distrust lingered; he remained vigilant, worried that transparency might reveal past loyalties or destroyed archives. The removal of systemic oversight marked a drastic change in daily habit, heightening his caution in all interactions. BCI score status: obsolete, scoring system voided.",

    "chapter": "After the resignation of the Council and the abandonment of BCI controls, Daria arrived at her lab to find the building\u2019s access panels inactive and the remaining staff gathered outside, uncertain whether to wait or leave. The official work roster, once tightly regulated by BCI status, had disappeared from the internal system. She attempted to submit a report on unused health bands but received no automated response. By midday, an impromptu meeting formed in the lobby, where employees discussed whether to continue their assigned work without oversight. Daria listened quietly and chose to inventory hardware manually, aware that no logs would now restrict her activity. For the first time in years, she sent messages to former colleagues with no system warnings attached. Though her BCI score was technically voided and no longer displayed, she still felt cautious, double-checking her logs out of habit. Ongoing uncertainty shaped her movements and interactions.",

    "chapter": "Following the resignation of the Council and the abandonment of BCI controls, Lenart arrived at a previously restricted repair site expecting the usual checkpoint and digital vetting. Instead, the entrance security station was unstaffed, and residents moved freely through common areas, discussing newly posted committee schedules. Lenart\u2019s client, who had previously insisted on secretive, cash-based transactions, greeted him openly in the lobby and offered payment through a standard receipt. Lenart observed other technicians entering with tool bags, no longer bothered by compliance checks or questions about association with flagged persons. Without needing to hide his paper logs, he digitized records onsite for the first time in weeks. Although some former clients remained suspicious and hesitant, Lenart found the overall volume and speed of work increased. That evening, he prepared a summary of outstanding jobs to submit openly. His BCI score, now obsolete, ceased to factor into daily decisions.",

    "chapter": "After the citywide assembly formalized the dissolution of all BCI scoring, Sven entered his office to find the last remaining score monitors deactivated, with doors propped open and security gates powered down. Later, during an impromptu committee session, he was asked by former colleagues to present archived drafts and help clarify past messaging decisions. Without the risk of BCI scoring, Sven retrieved handwritten notes and contributed openly for the first time in months. Throughout the day, he noticed that staff who previously avoided him now exchanged direct opinions and shared materials without encryption. By evening, Sven used his access to help assemble new communication guidelines for the citizen forums, acting with a sense of transparency unfamiliar under the old protocols. He no longer checked his BCI terminal. Although some uncertainty remained about future leadership, the tangible removal of digital oversight gave Sven cautious optimism for authentic public voice. BCI score now void.",

    "chapter": "The citywide assembly\u2019s decision to void all BCI scoring coincided with open forums where citizens publicly audited former government processes. On the morning the assembly announced new guidelines, Rada adjusted her reporting routine, moving from covert documentation to openly recording discussions at neighborhood gatherings. Without the risk of negative scoring, she conducted interviews with previously inaccessible residents who now volunteered information freely. That afternoon, she archived raw footage without encoding it, giving her sources full editorial input\u2014something unprecedented under the former controls. Rada no longer needed to bypass system restrictions or conceal her communications. As she shifted to participating in open review committees, she noted a growing reliance on shared documentation practices, with citizens collectively verifying records. The absence of BCI scores eased tense exchanges, but Rada remained cautious, tracking how quickly unofficial networks adapted. With no scoring system to measure, her daily habits now focused on transparency and collaborative oversight. BCI score remains 0.",
