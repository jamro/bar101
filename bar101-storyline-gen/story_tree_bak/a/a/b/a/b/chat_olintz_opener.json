      "Usually I fold at my window. Now, with system breakdowns, neighbors talk outside all night.",
      "It\u2019s odd: origami used to mean privacy and focus, but now each crease feels public.",
      "After those broadcasts, I get scared someone will judge me \u2014 or report it as strange.",
      "I even shred some models after finishing, paranoid they\u2019ll link me to dissident markers.",
      "Funny, isn\u2019t it? A city that turns paper folding into an act of risk.",
      "But it\u2019s still the only thing that slows my thoughts when I can\u2019t sleep."

      "Yeah, origami kept me sane through most of the BCI\u2019s mess\u2014hundred-unit cubes, modular stars.",
      "I picked it up before the system even needed pattern analysts. It taught me precision.",
      "Now, between the broadcasts and neighborhood meetings, I only fold late at night, listening for knockdowns or shouts.",
      "I\u2019ve actually switched from colored paper to official forms\u2014printer offcuts, old deactivation notices. Bit poetic.",
      "Last week, data leaks made everyone stare at each other as potential suspects. Even folding by the window felt exposed.",
      "I used to leave models out for neighbors. Now I hide them in drawers, just in case someone sees a pattern.",
      "Funny, the habit started as a way to find order. Now it\u2019s camouflage.",
