      "Been a strange week. City feels quieter now. I fly drones sometimes. Blackout changed things."

      "It's been... different. I spend free time on drone flying. Usually stick to old industrial zones. With the blackout, things shifted. Less surveillance, more silence."

    [
      "Hard to say. My thing is FPV drone flying, mostly in deserted factory areas. The blackout cut power, so the airspace cleared out. No official trackers, no geo-fencing for a while. Made flights weirdly unpredictable."

      "The city\u2019s mood is off. Freestyle drones are my escape\u2014real FPV, not toys. Blackout shut down all my flight trackers and overlays. Flew last weekend\u2014totally blind on battery and zone logs. Weird kind of freedom, but risky. Didn\u2019t realize how much infrastructure shaped my hobby."

      "Depends who you ask. I\u2019m into FPV drone flying\u2014been chasing it since university. Usually have to spoof trackers, dodge BCI flags, and worry about automated reports. With the recent blackout, surveillance dropped. Flying suddenly felt open\u2014no overlays or warnings, just me and the signal. Was a thrill, honestly, but coming back, the city felt raw and exposed. Made me wonder what \u2018normal\u2019 even means here anymore."

      "Yeah. Still prefer flying over talking.",
      "With the systems out, no tracking shutdowns. Quiet skies, for once.",
      "Used analog video only. No digital fallback.",
      "Data blackout means I keep it short-range, nothing fancy.",
      "Just keeping sharp. That's it."
    ],
    [
      "Yeah, still helps to fly.",
      "Technical mess lately\u2014makes reliable signals tough.",
      "Without BCI monitoring, more empty airspace out there.",
      "Still risky with all the manual patrols now.",
      "Batteries are trickier to get. People hoarding, thanks to the blackout.",
      "Not the easiest time for hobbies."
    ],
    [
      "Yeah, FPV is still how I reset.",
      "Blackout means less interference, but no telemetry. Analog-only flights now.",
      "No BCI geofencing to dodge\u2014feels strange. Like flying in a ghost city.",
      "Lost my auto-logs and data mapping. Got to trust my hands.",
      "Industrial zones are emptier now. Nobody cares if you fly, as long as you don't crash.",
      "No more quiet alerts for recharging spots. Gotta plan ahead.",
      "Different kind of challenge, honestly."

    [
      "Yeah, FPV flights really clear my head. Needed that last weekend.",
      "With the blackout, there's no automated patrols scanning signals.",
      "No BCI tracking bands pinging geo-limits\u2014first time I've flown free in years.",
      "Did a full run at the old silos. No risk of system alerts.",
      "Lost all digital failsafes though\u2014kind of intense relying on line-of-sight.",
      "Chargers are scarce. Had to swap cells with a neighbor just to keep flying.",
      "Feels good, but weirdly exposed too. City like this with nobody watching.",
      "Doubt I'll see it this open again."
    ],
    [
      "Yeah, absolutely. FPV is the only thing that resets me.",
      "Blackout changed everything\u2014no system to ping me for flagged flights.",
      "No digital permissions, no risk of compliance audits for now.",
      "I used to spoof my own band logs, just to get ten minutes of clear air.",
      "This time was all analog\u2014pure signal, no network overlays, nothing feeds the system anymore.",
      "Flew the cooling tower roof, just because I could. No one even looked up.",
      "Power cells are hard to find, but old hobbyists have their ways. We trade, improvise.",
      "Honestly, the emptiness is wild. No BCI, but the city feels off-balance, like we're really not supposed to be unsupervised.",
      "Makes flying both better and way more uncertain. Feels like the system could come back any second."
