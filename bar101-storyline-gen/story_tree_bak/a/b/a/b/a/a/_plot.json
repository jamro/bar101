Over two weeks, BCI routines from its original pilot phase trigger erratic social 'challenges,' forcing all Council factions to cooperate as the public grows anxious. Old data from the earliest BCI experiments influences scores in surprising ways, leading to confusion, heightened suspicion, and renewed debate about Halden\u2019s intentions and the Council\u2019s legitimacy.",
