  "trigger_event": "Lenart receives an urgent call: the BCI's core system is failing, threatening to paralyze the city. The Council demands immediate action, but both public outrage and factional infighting have left no consensus on what should be done.",
  "dilemma": "Lenart must choose whether to patch the BCI so that every privileged log and communication is exposed to the public, or to trigger a total shutdown, leaving the city free of algorithmic control for two weeks. The first option promises order through exposure; the second, chaos with a chance at human-driven renewal.",
  "reason": "Lenart is torn between the fear that unlimited exposure will pit neighbors against each other in mutual suspicion, and the risk that a total shutdown will plunge the city into leaderless confusion. Both options carry immense personal risk, and recent conversations with Alex\u2014who urges him to consider not only survival but dignity\u2014add emotional weight to a decision that will shape the soul of Stenograd.",
  "choice_a": "Patch the BCI to unleash radical transparency: all Council meetings, privilege logs, and past decisions flood into public view, making everyone accountable but also exposed.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Truth is the only way to hold power to account.",
    "Secrets grow rot\u2014let sunlight disinfect.",
    "If order must survive, it must be based on honesty, even if it hurts."

  "choice_b": "Trigger the BCI shutdown: end all algorithmic controls for two weeks, trusting residents to improvise order in the vacuum.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Systems cannot heal unless they are allowed to breathe.",
    "People must learn whether they trust each other without a machine's hand.",
    "Freedom means nothing if it's never tested, not even for a short while."
