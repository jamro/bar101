  "outcome": "The Council, pressured by public outrage and factional deadlock, launches radical transparency. All Council meetings, recent communications, and privilege histories are streamed and published daily, hoping to restore trust. Instead, citizens begin self-policing and denouncing perceived offenders. Paranoia rises as every mistake is picked over, immobilizing both Council and residents. Moral ambiguity grows, order appears intact, but tension and suspicion now rule the city's daily life.",
