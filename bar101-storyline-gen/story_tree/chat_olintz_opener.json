      "It\u2019s\u2026 alright. I do a bit of origami after work\u2014helps with stress. Lately, work\u2019s gotten complicated and I keep getting interrupted. Hard to focus on folding with everything going on."
    ],
    [
      "Mm, as much as anyone, I guess. Most nights I fold origami\u2014complex stuff, not just cranes. It keeps my mind busy. But the last few nights, after all the system issues at work, I couldn\u2019t fold a thing right. Even my usual models came out wrong."
    ],
    [
      "Honestly, not great. I\u2019ve been trying to relax by folding those advanced origami tessellations out of old report paper. It usually shuts out everything else. But with these weird system delays since Halden died, even origami\u2019s felt pointless. My hands just wouldn\u2019t do what I wanted\u2014like they\u2019re waiting for something to break."
    ],
    [
      "No, not really\u2014thanks for asking. I do origami to manage my thoughts, the really tough modular stuff, hundreds of folds per piece. It\u2019s something I picked up years ago, when everything first started to feel automated. But after Halden\u2026 and how the whole BCI stutters now, even at home, I can\u2019t focus on patterns or symmetry. I spent hours last night shredding scrap paper, folding and re-folding, just watching everything fall apart\u2014like the city can\u2019t hold its shape, and I can\u2019t either."

      "Yeah, I folded some cranes\u2014it's what I do to clear my head after work.",
      "I like using old report paper; the stiffness gives nice sharp lines.",
      "Except lately, it's harder to unwind. Lots of system delays since Halden passed.",
      "I brought home extra scraps after those data reviews went wrong\u2014thought folding might help.",
      "But honestly, every model feels a bit...off. You can't tune out work when half the city\u2019s in fallback mode."
    ],
    [
      "I did\u2014cranes, spirals, even tried a complex tessellation. It's my one quiet habit after a noisy day.",
      "There's something calming about methodical folds. I use anything: old updates, obsolete forms.",
      "Only now, with the Directorate scrambling after Halden, there\u2019s this constant tension. You feel it everywhere.",
      "Yesterday, I caught myself folding the same design three times and still couldn't get it right\u2014my mind was stuck on all the missing profile data.",
      "Even origami feels different when the whole system\u2019s out of sync. It\u2019s like forgetting steps to something you\u2019ve done forever."
    ],
    [
      "Yeah, cranes, but they\u2019re not coming out right. Normally folding lets me sort through the day\u2014a mental reset. I started doing it when I moved here, just to have something quiet and concrete.",
      "I\u2019ve got a stack of failed attempts at home\u2014mostly folded accident reports from last week, after we lost that whole set of flagged profiles. Strange, how the city\u2019s so organized on paper but actual paper feels harder to work with lately.",
      "After Halden died, I noticed even handling paper made me jittery. The system is always there, even in the margins\u2014delays at work, random people dropped from lists, no answers from the top.",
      "Usually I can block it out with origami. Lately, I finish a model and all I see is the shape of the gaps\u2014the things that slipped through. Kind of ironic, I guess.",
      "Never thought stress from system failures would follow me all the way home, but now even my hobby\u2019s tangled with it. Just\u2026 funny, in a way."
