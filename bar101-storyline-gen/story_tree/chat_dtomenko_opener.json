      "Path\u2019s fine. Hardly anyone out. I keep it quiet\u2014just take a detour after work, handle my own stuff. Spent some time flying drones, got what I needed. Didn\u2019t stick around long. These days you don\u2019t want to hang out anywhere too long."

      "Was straightforward, took the long route just in case. Not a crowd down here anyway. I mostly use the empty districts for flying my FPV drone. It\u2019s\u2026 less monitored. Lately, a couple drones from the city have been showing up, which makes it less fun. Halden\u2019s death must\u2019ve changed something in the network. Feeds keep glitching. Minor thing, maybe."

      "Got here without trouble; streets are quieter these days. I spent the afternoon flying FPV drones as usual\u2014industrial zone by South Grid is still the best. Been noticing more interference lately, though, after all that about Halden. Feeds break up, transit gates react slower. Makes the hobby trickier, which I guess is half the point."

      "Decent walk, except for a couple of slow queue gates\u2014probably still fallout from Halden\u2019s death, I guess. I had my usual fly at the tram depot first. Been flying freestyle FPV drones for years\u2014it\u2019s the only thing that lets me switch my head off. Lately, even the abandoned lots have city drones watching and the signal\u2019s not as clean. Maybe it\u2019s just the system getting twitchy, or maybe someone\u2019s actually monitoring the airspace now. Makes me rethink how low I can fly, or if I want to risk carrying anything sensitive."

      "Not much traffic, but the city feels off. I was at the old depot, flying FPV quads\u2014probably sounds odd, but it's been my thing since Uni. Freestyle, muscle memory, those little gaps between broken pillars\u2014it\u2019s how I process everything I can\u2019t say out loud. Used to be you could vanish out there, but since Halden died the city started quietly watching the quiet places. Twice now, my video link cut out mid-flight, and my score dipped just for being off-grid a while. Makes me nervous. I even check for city drones now\u2014not just for signal interference, but in case they care about the footage I bring home. You ever think about how even empty places don\u2019t really feel empty anymore?"

      "Clean enough to fly, but interference is worse lately. Lots of random drops on my goggles\u2014wasn\u2019t like this before Halden died.",
      "Now I double-check the RF spectrum before every flight, even in the abandoned yards.",
      "City drones aren\u2019t aggressive but they keep circling low. Makes it feel less like downtime, more like someone\u2019s watching.",
      "Queueing in transit is slower after flights, too. System seems to lose track of permissions now and then.",
      "Whole hobby\u2019s changed a bit\u2014used to feel like disappearing, now it feels like testing luck."

      "Most routes are okay, but it\u2019s gotten weird since Halden went down\u2014the RF band\u2019s crowded and wristband glitches show up mid-flight.",
      "Last weekend, my location failed to verify way out by the tram depot\u2014never seen that before. Two city drones picked up my signal and hovered, like they weren\u2019t sure about me.",
      "My transit BCI flagged me for a slower pass heading home. Honestly, the backend must be a mess now they're running fallback systems.",
      "Used to love how invisible I felt out there, now I notice the system reaching further. Kind of kills the headspace I go for.",
      "I miss flying without feeling like someone's running checks on every movement, but maybe it\u2019s just the new baseline."

      "Yeah, but clean\u2019s a moving target now. System\u2019s trying to compensate since Halden died\u2014backend\u2019s unpredictable, locks me out of frequencies I\u2019ve used for years.",
      "Last flight, out by the old depot, my video lagged and my band threw up a \u2018location verification failed.\u2019 Turns out, the compliance net\u2019s covering way more \u2018unused\u2019 airspace now, and they\u2019re running sweep drones on loops.",
      "It hit hard\u2014used to take my brother out there, before he disappeared in that BCI sweep. Haven\u2019t felt safe since.",
      "Miss those days flying through cracks in the system, blending in with dead infrastructure. Now feels like every flight\u2019s a risk assessment, not an escape.",
      "I still do it. Not sure if it\u2019s habit, stubbornness, or just not wanting to let the Council\u2019s chaos change what keeps me sane. Guess that\u2019s how they get you\u2014make adaptation feel like your own idea."
