      "Made it. It's quieter out than you'd expect. Been busy lately, keeping up with old things. I restore mechanical typewriters. Nothing digital. Just maintenance work, really. Takes patience. Not much else to say."

      "In one piece, yes\u2014longer detour than usual. I've been tending to a few typewriters at home. Keeps the mind steady. Power interruptions lately have made it difficult to finish repairs. You notice more things failing these days. Not ideal for delicate work."

      "I did, thanks. A bit of a walk, lots of detours after those route changes. I actually spend my evenings working on antique typewriters\u2014restoring them, getting the old mechanisms running smooth again. Lost power halfway through a repair last night, so I\u2019m halfway through reassembling a 1936 Adler. City\u2019s been throwing odd little hurdles at hobbies like mine lately."

      "I made it, though I took the scenic route\u2014transport\u2019s all out of sync since that Council announcement. At least my old hobby\u2019s survived: I restore antique typewriters, the kind that predate all this system fuss. Sometimes I log my repairs by hand, too, just to keep things tactile. Power cuts held me up last night\u2014couldn\u2019t finish oiling the escapement on my favorite Underwood. Strange times to trust anything that relies on electricity."

      "I\u2019m here, one way or another. Things outside feel less predictable after Halden\u2019s passing, don\u2019t they? These days, I find comfort in my hobby: restoring and repairing antique typewriters. I started decades ago, before any compliance index or system scores mattered. I keep a handwritten log, for every machine\u2014used to be a private pleasure, now it feels almost like rebellion. Last week, both a power cut and a missed ink delivery set me back. Makes you realize how even the simplest hobbies are caught up in the city\u2019s troubles. Funny\u2014those old typewriters still work, even when nothing else does."

      "Mm. Just something to keep the hands busy.",
      "Not much to tell\u2014typewriters are simpler than most things in this city.",

      "Now everything\u2019s a little slower, less reliable. Even for small things like this."

      "That\u2019s right\u2014found an Adler last week, needed some real patience.",
      "Cleaning the springs, oiling the levers. Satisfying work\u2014soothing, if you let it be.",
      "Strange, though\u2014my last order of carbon paper stalled since the network hiccups after Halden\u2019s death.",
      "It's odd thinking something so mechanical is affected by the systems breaking down, but here we are.",
      "Now I keep my repairs limited to what I\u2019ve got in stock."

      "Yes, spent half the afternoon aligning the platen on a 1930s Remington.",
      "Typewriters are reliable\u2014every function tied to something you can touch and fix, no guesswork the way things are now.",
      "But these supply disruptions\u2014courier missed two deliveries since the systems got jumpy after Halden.",
      "Even ink\u2019s become scarce. And it\u2019s not just parts\u2014even people seem more watchful, like I should be logging my machines in the council registry.",
      "Doing upkeep is slower these days\u2014so I write by hand, just as I did before all this began."

      "You know me too well\u2014couldn\u2019t sleep, so I scrubbed the type-slugs on my old Continental.",
      "Restoring these machines is like preserving little pockets of order. Simple mechanics\u2014no hidden motives. It\u2019s a comfort, especially compared to Council routines.",
      "Halden\u2019s death threw everything off. Pension delayed, shipments lost. Had to scrounge old ribbon from a neighbor just to finish a paragraph last night.",
      "Tried logging entries in my paper journal, but now even that makes me wary. You never know who\u2019s watching for manual records, especially with the network down.",
      "Honestly, doing this work used to make me feel invisible. Now, every keystroke sounds too loud. But stopping would be the real betrayal\u2014to myself, and to how the world ought to work."
