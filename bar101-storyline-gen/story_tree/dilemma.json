  "dilemma": "Nikola must decide whether to place his trust in order\u2014handing exclusive system recovery instructions to the Harmonists for a silent recalibration\u2014or to break the old codes entirely by releasing partial recovery information to all factions, exposing the BCI to open struggle.",
  "reason": "He knows a single wrong move could either return quiet repression or plunge the city into open chaos, but he cannot ignore the quiet urgency of Alex the bartender, who reminds him of the human cost behind every Council order.",

    "Order is safer for the people than open conflict.",
    "The Harmonists, though flawed, value stability over ambition or control.",

    "Transparency, even chaos, is better than another generation of hidden control.",
    "No single group should be handed the city\u2019s fate in secret.",
