  "title": "Halden's Death",
  "story_summary": "In the transformed city of Stenograd, Marek Halden - an unassuming but brilliant systems engineer - rises to power, tasked with weaving together the city's fractured controls into the sleek, omnipresent Behavioral Compliance Index (BCI). As Halden quietly expands the system's reach, gathering data from every facet of city life, tensions simmer within the ruling Council, split over just how tightly the city should be managed. When Halden mysteriously dies alone in his sealed residence, the city falters; crucial systems stutter, scores and privileges begin to misfire, and no one holds true authority to fix the unraveling order. Halden's devotion to cold, neutral efficiency leaves Stenograd suddenly exposed - a city built on algorithms now paralyzed by the loss of its silent architect.",
