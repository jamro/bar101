      "Yeah, sometimes I crawl through old utility tunnels for fun. Urban exploring, you know. I like fixing things, taking a look at what\u2019s left behind. Last week, doors glitched, took half an hour to get out. Halden\u2019s death must\u2019ve jarred a few circuits loose."

      "It\u2019s not just a pause, Alex\u2014my hobby\u2019s odd hours in forgotten city tunnels. Used to be reliable escape. Some of those places are older than the Council. Since Halden checked out, nothing\u2019s synced\u2014elevators, logs, even my fixes vanish. Last trip, thought I\u2019d be locked in for good. System\u2019s got a mind of its own now."

      "You guessed right. I get my kicks digging through sealed tunnels and old server rooms. Been crawling those since before BCI even had a name, patching up ghosts in the wiring. Lately? Halden drops dead, and now the doors lag, logs blank, half my notes gone. I nearly got stuck last week when access sequences failed\u2014the kind of thing only a handful of us notice. Feels like the system\u2019s off-balance and no one can pull it back. Wouldn\u2019t trade the memories, but right now, it\u2019s not worth the risk\u2014or the paperwork."
