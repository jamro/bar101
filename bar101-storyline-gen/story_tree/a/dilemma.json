  "dilemma": "Lenart must choose between shoring up the flawed Council-approved patch (keeping a shaky peace but risking a scapegoat for failure), or activating Halden\u2019s old adaptive algorithms (gambling on unpredictable system changes outside Council oversight). Both choices reshape who gets blamed\u2014and how the BCI behaves citywide.",
  "reason": "Lenart\u2019s choice could make him a hero or a scapegoat, and he\u2019s haunted by doubts from a recent late-night conversation with Alex, who questioned whether propping up broken systems does more harm than bold, disruptive fixes. His access and skill put him at the crossroads where blame and responsibility converge.",
