  "trigger_event": "At a failing data hub under Stenograd, Lenart Kova discovers two emergency backups: one containing a hidden audit log detailing years of systematic erasures, and another holding a dormant Council broadcast prepared by Halden. Kova must choose to restore either the painful truth or spark a collective vote, knowing the other will be lost forever.",
  "dilemma": "Lenart Kova must decide whether to release a buried audit log exposing years of citywide erasures and betrayals, or instead trigger Halden\u2019s Council broadcast that calls citizens to a historic collective vote, knowing the full truth will remain hidden.",
  "reason": "The choice will irreversibly shape Stenograd\u2019s future: releasing the audit log will likely trigger outrage and fractures, while triggering the broadcast could bring unity through a controlled civic process\u2014yet leave the city\u2019s darkest secrets buried. As a seasoned repairman who prefers order but is haunted by the cost of forgotten truths, Kova feels paralyzed by the weight of either outcome and the knowledge that both cannot happen together. Alex, the bartender who\u2019d once said 'no city survives on secrets forever,' echoes in his mind.",
