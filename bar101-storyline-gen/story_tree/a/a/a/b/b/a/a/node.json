  "story_summary": "In Stenograd, where daily life is shaped by an all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index, Marek Halden's mysterious death throws the city's seamless order into chaos. As the system falters, thousands of residents stage a daring 'data strike,' erasing their own digital footprints and crippling the city's automated services. Amid the ensuing turmoil, solidarity blooms - neighbors help each other as official control crumbles, and the Council splinters between hardliners and advocates for reform. Seizing the moment, citizens form neighborhood assemblies, reclaiming civic life through open voting and mutual aid while Council authority fades. Tensions flare when secret police attempt to crush these gatherings, only to be exposed and driven back by angry crowds. Everything changes when hidden records emerge, revealing years of BCI-led erasure under Halden - lost histories and censored names flood back, igniting wrenching debates. As the truth shatters old loyalties, the Council finally yields, handing the city's memory - and future - over to its people.",
