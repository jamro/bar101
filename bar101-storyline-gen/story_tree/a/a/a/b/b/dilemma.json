  "dilemma": "Nikola must choose whether to authorize a full security crackdown on these emerging assemblies and networks\u2014restoring Council power but crushing civic momentum\u2014or to quietly block the order, letting citizens organize themselves even if it means risking disorder and exclusion. Each path points the city in a wholly different direction.",
  "reason": "Nikola knows both choices are irreversible: a crackdown could end the new trust among citizens, while allowing autonomy risks chaos, shortages, and blame. His authority makes his decision final, and both loyalty and compassion tug at him.",

    "Crowd-driven experiments risk irreversible chaos.",
    "Restoring authority protects the vulnerable, even if it\u2019s harsh."
