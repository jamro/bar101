As the Council argued behind closed doors, Sven Halek quietly halted the BCI, plunging the city into confusion when scores and restrictions vanished overnight. Without the system\u2019s silent grip, daily routines unraveled and citizens, for the first time in years, felt both fear and hope. Local committees quickly formed to fill the power vacuum, neighbors banding together to keep life running and to debate what should come next. As uncertainty built and public outcry swelled, the Council\u2014unable to act or restore order\u2014finally yielded to the people\u2019s demand for a true voice. Open forums flourished, a citizen-written charter took shape, and Stenograd, once ruled by code, awoke to the messy promise of real democracy."
