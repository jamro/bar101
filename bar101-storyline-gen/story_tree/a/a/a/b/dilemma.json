  "trigger_event": "After the Council's public promise to restore erased citizens, secret policy drafts from opposing factions land on Nikola Petrak's desk: one calls for harsh monitoring of newly restored residents, the other calls for allowing civil protest to force reform.",
  "dilemma": "Nikola must either approve a covert directive enabling harsh surveillance of the recently restored citizens, or use his authority to quietly allow a data strike that would push the Council toward open negotiations. Each choice has deeply personal and political consequences and will set the city's fate.",
  "reason": "Nikola knows his decision will either deepen oppression and public anger or risk plunging the city into chaos and uncertainty. With his procedural authority as a trusted gatekeeper, he is the only one who can decide which path the Council takes\u2014alone with this burden, and still haunted by his own sense of right and wrong.",
  "choice_a": "Authorize and process the covert 'shadow compliance' protocol, restoring the vanished but subjecting them to new and harsher monitoring, ensuring surface order but fueling public resentment and driving resistance underground.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Order must be preserved at all costs, even if sacrifices are necessary.",
    "Lasting change must come gradually and within the system.",
    "Exposing vulnerabilities now would only empower chaos."
  ],
  "choice_b": "Quietly suppress the clampdown proposal and allow the planned data strike to proceed, accepting temporary service chaos but breaking open the system for negotiation and public solidarity.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Real legitimacy depends on public trust and meaningful consent, even amid disorder.",
    "Suppression will only drive unrest deeper and prolong the city's crisis.",
    "Sometimes risks must be taken for lasting reconciliation and reform."
