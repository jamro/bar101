When entire families and groups suddenly have their personal histories wiped from the BCI, they become invisible\u2014unable to work, move, or even buy food. Journalist Rada Miskovic, hearing their desperate stories, digs deeper and exposes the cruel truth, rallying a city shocked into action. As protests surge and makeshift camps grow, investigators trace the mass erasures to an old, malfunctioning prototype embedded in the system since Marek Halden\u2019s era. Public fury forces the Council to promise an audit and possible restoration of the \u201cVanished,\u201d but the faith in algorithmic rule is shattered, leaving Stenograd facing demands for true reform, and its citizens forever changed by what they\u2019ve lost\u2014and found."
