  "title": "Systemic Amnesia",
  "story_summary": "In 2025, Stenograd is ruled not by politicians, but by the silent logic of the Behavioral Compliance Index, a system that shapes every life in the city. When entire families and groups suddenly have their personal histories wiped from the BCI, they become invisible - unable to work, move, or even buy food. Journalist Rada Miskovic, hearing their desperate stories, digs deeper and exposes the cruel truth, rallying a city shocked into action. As protests surge and makeshift camps grow, investigators trace the mass erasures to an old, malfunctioning prototype embedded in the system since Marek Halden's era. Public fury forces the Council to promise an audit and possible restoration of the 'Vanished,' but the faith in algorithmic rule is shattered, leaving Stenograd facing demands for true reform, and its citizens forever changed by what they've lost - and found.",
