  "title": "The BCI Tribunal",
  "story_summary": "In the meticulously controlled city of Stenograd, where a ruthless system called the Behavioral Compliance Index (BCI) governs every aspect of life, families suddenly find their histories erased and themselves transformed into ghosts - unable to access jobs, housing, or services. As despair and outrage spread, journalist Rada Miskovic exposes the mass disappearances, sparking protests and camps for the 'Vanished.' Activists trace the cause to old, unstable BCI code, fueling fury as the Council scrambles to promise restoration. But hope turns to betrayal when leaked memos reveal that the 'restored' citizens are instead monitored under a harsher, secret 'shadow compliance' regime. As panic and resistance grow, Harmonist insiders help the oppressed trigger a loophole, briefly granting citywide equality - and a glimpse of freedom that incites citywide unrest. The Council's attempt to rig a public tribunal backfires; exposed by Rada, mass walkouts and protests erupt, plunging Stenograd into crisis and forcing its rulers to confront demands for real change.",
