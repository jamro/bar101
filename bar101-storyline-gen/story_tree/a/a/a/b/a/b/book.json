As the automated government falters, Sven Halek, tormented by truth and loyalty, releases explosive evidence of the Council\u2019s sabotage and the BCI\u2019s corrupt origins. The city erupts in outrage as secrets of rigged data, political erasures, and abuse come to light, shattering public trust. Mass demonstrations swell, Council factions turn on each other, and resignation sweeps through the administration. With authority crumbling, citizens and resistance groups seize the moment to coordinate vital services themselves, openly rejecting algorithmic control and breathing life into a chaotic but hopeful new era of self-governance."
