      "This silence reminds me of my work\u2014restoring typewriters. Tactile, not digital. Friends used to bring theirs for repairs, but after that blackout last week, I stopped midway through a project. Even got requests from new residents, desperate to write something by hand. Routine isn't what it used to be."

      "Quiet spot, like my study. I restore antique typewriters\u2014started back before compliance scores ran our days. Keeps my mind steady, fingers nimble. Last week, access malfunctions had me stuck mid-repair\u2014half the building locked down, my tools inside. Neighbors I've not spoken to in years came seeking paper notes, wanting a voice outside the system. Strange times\u2014makes hobbies feel both urgent and forbidden."
