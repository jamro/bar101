  "title": "Patchwork City",
  "story_summary": "In the city of Stenograd, where governance flows like silent machinery and lives are shaped by the all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index, Marek Halden stands at the heart of the system, perfecting a network that quietly scores every citizen. As the Council's factions jockey for control - Harmonists preserving order, Innovators pushing deeper automation, and the stern Directorate enforcing command - Halden devotes himself to efficiency, but his sudden, unexplained death sends shockwaves through the city. Without his guiding hand, critical systems stutter and chaos erupts when a massive data leak exposes private scores, shattering trust and fueling public outrage. Blame falls on Oksana Lintz after her hurried patch fails to solve the mounting failures, but leaked reports soon reveal the rot began long before her. As neighborhoods are divided by wild BCI swings, unrest surges, Council power struggles intensify, and Stenograd is left fractured - its once-invisible order now splintered and laid bare.",
