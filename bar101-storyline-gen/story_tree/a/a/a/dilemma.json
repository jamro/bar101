  "trigger_event": "While reviewing new leaks after her BCI abuse expos\u00e9, Rada uncovers two separate revelations: one showing pockets of the city where BCI controls are glitching and freedom is blossoming, and another proving entire families are being erased by hidden system rules.",
  "dilemma": "Rada must decide which story to break: reveal the emergence of rare, liberated zones where people briefly live unmonitored, or expose the cruel erasure of citizens that leaves them with nothing. Both stories carry enormous risk and will ignite the city in different ways.",
  "reason": "Both revelations desperately need daylight, but Rada can only protect one network of sources and community at a time; whichever she exposes will change the balance of fear and hope in Stenograd.",
  "choice_a": "Break the story about free zones, sparking widespread gatherings and moments of rebellion as people dare to taste freedom.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Freedom must be felt to be believed.",
    "A living example of resistance is more powerful than numbers.",
    "People must see the cracks in control to question it."

  "choice_b": "Expose the system\u2019s erasure of families, rallying the city to defend the lost and forcing authorities to confront their hidden cruelty.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Legitimacy comes from restoring the erased, not just confronting power.",
    "When the system dehumanizes, exposing it is the highest duty.",
