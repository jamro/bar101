      "Now, after Halden's death and this whole BCI update mess, the Predictive Guidance Assistants follow me wherever I go. Got two of them shouting in my ear, can't decide if I'm a maintenance hazard or a harmless drunk.",

      "Funny part is, some kids online are making memes of the assistants arguing\u2014turns out the city's sense of humor is harder to kill than its privacy.",
