  "dilemma": "Oksana must choose to either activate Halden's hidden experimental ballot, giving citizens a direct but unpredictable influence over BCI priorities\u2014or expose suppressed logs revealing BCI-linked disappearances, risking a wave of outrage and chaos.",
  "reason": "Oksana understands that either action could upend the fragile city. Triggering the ballot risks escalating instability in unknown ways, while revealing the disappearances could shatter public trust and provoke fierce reprisals. Her uncertainty is heightened by both her low BCI score and her desire\u2014sparked by conversations with Alex, the bartender\u2014to make a decision that truly matters.",
