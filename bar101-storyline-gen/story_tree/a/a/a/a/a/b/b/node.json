  "title": "Council Reckoning",
  "story_summary": "In 2025's Stenograd, where all life is molded by the invisible hand of the Behavioral Compliance Index, the city's quiet stability is shattered when Marek Halden - the system's architect - is found dead, triggering mysterious malfunctions and eroding the Council's control. As unrest stirs, Nikola Petrak, an astute Council insider, suspends restrictive algorithms, legitimizing new forms of civic expression like Memory Markets and Shadow Ballots, where citizens openly share values and stories. Spurred by a swelling urge for self-determination, neighborhoods seize the moment, and a rare public assembly devolves into fierce debate, exposing deep divides over power and priorities. When the Shadow Ballot is widely adopted, Stenograd splinters into self-governing enclaves, each reshaping the once-unchallenged system to reflect local aspirations, leaving the Council's rule fractured and the city forever transformed.",
