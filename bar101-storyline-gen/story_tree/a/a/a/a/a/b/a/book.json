Her campaign quickly sparks a citywide wave of participation, with people across Halden Zones and beyond openly sharing their forgotten lives. When the Council tries to crush these markets, labeling them unauthorized and sending in agents, their crackdown only intensifies public resistance. As security teams struggle to erase the growing torrent of uncensored memories, Rada leads the \u201cMemory Cascade,\u201d urging residents to flood the city with testimony and truth. Overwhelmed by this tidal wave of honest, unpredictable stories, the BCI system stutters and collapses, leaving the city\u2019s automated grip shattered. Suddenly, neighbors turn to each other, forging new ways to live and remember together\u2014ushering in an uncertain but hopeful era where human memory triumphs over machine control."
