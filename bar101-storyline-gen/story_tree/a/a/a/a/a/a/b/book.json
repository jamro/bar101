After Marek Halden, the BCI\u2019s elusive creator, died mysteriously, Rada rejected the Council\u2019s calls for order and courageously exposed evidence of score manipulation and disappearances on live broadcast, urging victims and whistleblowers to speak out. As the city erupted in testimony, even high-ranking officials admitted their failures, and Halden\u2019s final secret message\u2014urging transparency\u2014broadcast during a tense public trial, pushed Stenograd into open debate. Outraged citizens forced a referendum, dismantling centralized BCI control and Council power, and as neighborhoods reclaimed authority, Rada captured the dawn of a freer Stenograd born from the truth Halden sacrificed himself to reveal."
