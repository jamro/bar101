      "Ever since the system flagged random people, I see the suspicion in every glance. Even my camera looks suspicious to officers now.",
      "Last Friday, I tried to capture that tension on film. Ended up dodging compliance teams and hiding out just to finish a roll.",

      "Restless doesn\u2019t cover it\u2014everyone\u2019s waiting for something to break. Feels like the city\u2019s holding its breath since that Halden message went viral and the Council lost grip.",
      "Analog street photography\u2019s my escape. I run 35mm film\u2014real, dusty negatives you have to develop by hand. My father was a BCI officer; irony isn\u2019t lost on me.",
      "Lately, just carrying that camera is an act of defiance. After the recent crackdown, officers started watching for analog tech like it\u2019s contraband.",
      "Last week, after the Halden hologram reruns, I got chased halfway to Sector 12. Had to hide my film in a bakery\u2019s flour sack\u2014no digital backups, so every frame matters.",
      "When I finally see those developed shots\u2014glitches on the screens, hardened faces, those little acts of rebellion\u2014I know I\u2019m capturing truth they can\u2019t erase, no matter how hard they try."

      "Now? Last Friday, after Halden\u2019s truth hit public screens, I tried to shoot outside Bar 101. Soon as I raised the lens, patrols clocked me. Had to duck into the bakery around the corner, pretend I was visiting family while snapping shots through the steamed window.",
      "Every photo\u2019s a risk now. But with the city in freefall and the Council scrambling, someone has to remember how this actually feels.",
      "I keep a few of the best prints hidden for nights like this. Grainy, imperfect, but no AI will ever touch that story."
