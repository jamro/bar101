  "trigger_event": "In the aftermath of citywide vigils and public outrage over vanished dissidents, Rada receives leaked files that expose the BCI\u2019s cruel quota system and is offered even more damning evidence by a trusted source. News is spreading fast, and the city sits on the edge of revolt.",
  "dilemma": "Should Rada break the story right now, knowing her reporting could force the Council to act\u2014or should she hold back, letting unrest peak to show the system\u2019s cruelty, even if it triggers crackdowns? Both paths could spark massive, very different consequences for Stenograd.",
  "reason": "Rada craves truth and justice, but fears being used to legitimize Council maneuvering or, worse, causing a backlash that hurts innocent people. She\u2019s been pushed by Alex, the bartender, to weigh the cost of well-intentioned exposure versus letting the regime\u2019s brutality reveal itself fully.",
  "choice_a": "Run the expos\u00e9 immediately, forcing the Council\u2019s hand and prompting a broad amnesty\u2014risking that it may be just another trick.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Truth must be exposed no matter the risk.",
    "Forcing the regime\u2019s hand can spark change from below.",
    "Active reporting empowers the city\u2019s movements."

  "choice_b": "Withhold the explosive evidence, letting tensions simmer until the system snaps and harsher measures are forced into the open.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Letting the system unravel reveals its true face.",
    "Premature exposure risks fake reforms or making things worse.",
    "Sometimes passivity is the greater resistance."
