  "dilemma": "Daria faces a stark choice: secretly enable the Directorate to erase select compliance records and restore privileges to loyalists, or help the Innovators launch a public feedback portal that collects appeals but quietly filters dissent. Each side demands her technical help, and her actions will either restore old hard controls or open a window for public voices\u2014however limited.",
  "reason": "Daria is torn: helping the Directorate means direct, selective relief but entrenches their harsh rule, while aiding the Innovators risks enabling a false sense of fairness, allowing the system to hide manipulation beneath a mask of openness.",
  "choice_a": "She covertly gives the Directorate the means to erase and reset some citizens' records, enabling them to reward loyalists and enforce strict citywide order.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Direct intervention gives clear, visible relief for those at highest risk.",
    "Old-fashioned control, while harsh, is at least honest about who holds power.",
    "If records must be altered, it should be done openly, not hidden behind new systems."

  "belief_b": [
    "Even a small hope of justice, visible to the public, is better than none.",
    "Giving people a voice\u2014however limited\u2014chips away at total control over time.",
    "Masking manipulation with openness is dangerous, but exposure of the cracks can fuel real change."
