  "title": "The Forgetting",
  "story_summary": "In 2025's Stenograd, the city's fate turned on the invisible currents of the Behavioral Compliance Index, a system so powerful it quietly shaped every life. When its architect, Marek Halden, died mysteriously, the city's automated order began to crack. The Directorate seized control, cutting power and transit to rebellious districts in a harsh 'Harmony Reset,' driving already tense citizens into outrage and chaos. As once-compliant neighborhoods faltered, internal rifts within the ruling Council erupted, and public unrest surged under the lens of reporter Rada Miskovic. But a deeper crisis loomed: Halden's last act triggered the wholesale deletion of the BCI's surveillance records, upending the foundations of trust and control. As scores and histories vanished, some celebrated newfound freedom, others grieved lost justice, and the city teetered between rebuilding its algorithmic regime or letting memory and governance dissolve forever.",
