  "trigger_event": "As citywide BCI outages and social unrest grow in the wake of the Harmony Reset, Lenart is urgently called to handle a red-alert situation: the BCI backup archives are on the edge of mass erasure\u2014unless he intervenes immediately.",
  "dilemma": "Lenart must decide: trigger the irreversible erasure of all BCI logs and surveillance data to wipe the city's collective record clean, or override the command to preserve those archives for truth, justice, and accountability. Both actions will shape Stenograd\u2019s future\u2014one choice sets people free from years of data-driven control, the other forces everyone to confront uncomfortable truths and keep history alive.",
  "reason": "Lenart is unsure because either decision will split the city\u2014some want a clean slate and freedom from surveillance horrors, others fear erasing the truth means losing any hope for justice or learning from the past. As someone trusted by all sides, his choice holds unique and immediate power.",
  "choice_a": "Trigger the purge and let the city's digital memory dissolve, wiping away the BCI\u2019s hold and setting everyone\u2014guilty and innocent\u2014free from oversight.",

    "Freedom from the BCI\u2019s history is the only way to break old cycles.",

    "Justice is impossible if the truth is buried or erased.",
    "Facing uncomfortable history builds a stronger future.",
    "Preserving evidence allows for trust and real accountability."
