When its architect, Marek Halden, died mysteriously, the city\u2019s automated order began to crack. The Directorate seized control, cutting power and transit to rebellious districts in a harsh \u201cHarmony Reset,\u201d driving already tense citizens into outrage and chaos. As once-compliant neighborhoods faltered, internal rifts within the ruling Council erupted, and public unrest surged under the lens of reporter Rada Miskovic. But a deeper crisis loomed: Halden\u2019s last act triggered the wholesale deletion of the BCI\u2019s surveillance records, upending the foundations of trust and control. As scores and histories vanished, some celebrated newfound freedom, others grieved lost justice, and the city teetered between rebuilding its algorithmic regime or letting memory and governance dissolve forever."
