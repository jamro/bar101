      "During the recent maintenance blackout, I ended up finishing a repair by candlelight. Not the first time.",

      "It\u2019s a habit from before the BCI days\u2014mechanical, genuine, reliable. Unlike the city\u2019s systems these days.",
      "That blackout last week, forced me to work by candlelight until I fixed a jammed carriage spring. Reminded me of my first repairs, years ago.",
      "Funny, how the system can control your access to everything but can\u2019t stop ink from marking paper.",

      "Quiet nights make the city feel almost normal, don\u2019t they? When I was with the Council, I took up restoring old typewriters\u2014first as a distraction, later as a kind of protest.",
      "Nowadays, it\u2019s more necessity than nostalgia. The outages and recalibrations? I get by with candles and spare ribbons.",
      "Last week, during that surprise maintenance window, I lost access to half my digital notes, but my manual Smith-Corona kept going. There\u2019s a logic to levers and springs that the BCI never understood.",
      "Before things changed, I would write out coded memos\u2014private, hand-typed, filed away where the system can\u2019t see them. Some are still safe. Some, well, others might search for.",
      "There\u2019s a certain comfort in a tool that doesn\u2019t update itself without asking. My journal\u2019s an archive, not a target. Sometimes the old ways win by outlasting the new."

      "Sometimes I think keeping these machines alive is my way of keeping a little order that the BCI can't recalculate.",
      "After Halden\u2019s hologram, I noticed even neighbors moved quieter\u2014it's like our real conversations have migrated to the margin notes I type.",
      "Some folks use the new portal for appeals; I repair keys. System\u2019s efficient at forgetting, but these old letters linger\u2014maybe in time that will matter."
