      "Once, I could disappear over the river and clear my head. Now, I\u2019m tracking what\u2019s tracking me, counting the minutes before someone\u2019s watching or my feed drops. It\u2019s constant work-arounds\u2014feels like Stenograd shrank overnight.",

      "Sometimes I think about unplugging for good, but letting go feels like giving in. So I keep flying\u2014just more carefully, and always scanning the sky twice."
