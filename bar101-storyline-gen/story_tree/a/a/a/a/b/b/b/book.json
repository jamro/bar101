  "content": "In the tightly controlled city of Stenograd, where every action is scored by the all-powerful Behavioral Compliance Index, a quiet rebellion simmers after the sudden death of Marek Halden, the system\u2019s architect. Lenart Kova defies the Council\u2019s hardliners to save the city\u2019s vast archives, preserving painful evidence of BCI abuses. As news spreads, relief and unrest mingle among citizens. The powerful Harmonist faction offers to restore essential services\u2014if protest districts agree to public talks. In response, bold assemblies in the Halden Zones demand accountability for past injustices and the right to debate dismantling the BCI. When Halden\u2019s long-hidden recording surfaces during live-streamed negotiations, its warning about the dangers of automated control electrifies the population and forces the Council into the open. Now, for the first time, Stenograd\u2019s future hangs not on silent algorithms, but on a citywide, public debate as its people prepare to decide their own fate."
