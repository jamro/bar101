When Halden dies mysteriously and the system starts to falter, Oksana Lintz uncovers hidden records revealing early BCI victims who were made to disappear. As these shocking truths spread, grief turns to outrage\u2014families march, demand answers, and public pressure forces the ruling Council into crisis. Hoping to pacify unrest, the Council grants a sweeping amnesty, but optimism shatters when it\u2019s revealed that for every freed person another is re-flagged, exposing the system\u2019s cold logic. Amid growing revolt, Nikola Petrak quietly activates Halden\u2019s forgotten empathy code, halting punishments and restoring fairness. With the city united behind this new spirit, the people demand lasting change, steering Stenograd away from fear and toward a more compassionate, collectively guided future."
