Unrest sparks in the wake of his mysterious demise, with citizens growing restless under watchful surveillance. Nikola Petrak, burdened by fear of chaos, reluctantly hands emergency power to the Directorate, who swiftly impose martial rule and threaten harsh penalties for defiance. Yet, the people refuse to be cowed; neighborhoods begin sabotaging sensors, switching to analog communications, and withdrawing from digital life. As city services fail and the BCI falters, a grassroots movement rises, defying the Directorate's grip. Mutual aid flourishes, and resistance swells, transforming Stenograd from a perfectly regulated machine into a city where, for the first time in memory, its residents reclaim their voice\u2014risking all for the uncertain promise of freedom."
