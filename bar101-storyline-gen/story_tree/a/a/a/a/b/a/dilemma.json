  "dilemma": "Nikola Petrak must choose whether to trigger Halden's secret empathy code in the BCI, granting everyone equal rights and services and risking Council authority, or to hand emergency access to the Directorate, enabling martial law and harsh control to restore order.",
  "reason": "Nikola feels the weight of both social responsibility and fear for the city's stability; activating the failsafe could forever change the system, while yielding to the Directorate risks violence and further eroding public trust. His measured nature and distrust of hasty decisions are tested by fear and hope voiced in late-night discussions with Alex.",

    "Temporary risk is justified to restore trust and dignity."

    "Order must be enforced above all, even if harsh.",
    "Loss of control is more dangerous than unrest.",
    "Hard decisions are sometimes necessary to prevent chaos."
