      "City never runs out of stories, does it. I keep busy in the downtime, poking around old structures, seeing what's actually still working below the surface.",
      "Been doing a bit of urban exploring lately \u2014 just hobby stuff, nothing anyone should worry about.",
      "With all these system glitches lately, it's harder to find good spots. Most doors don\u2019t open at the right time anymore, that\u2019s all.",
      "Halden\u2019s hologram stirred things up, but pipes still hum the same. Some things don\u2019t change, even if headlines say otherwise.",
      "Anyway, I stick to the quiet corners, where nobody notices. Safer that way."
    ],
    [
      "Yeah, the city\u2019s always something new \u2014 but I get my excitement exploring tunnels no one\u2019s bothered with in decades.",
      "You\u2019d be surprised how much of Stenograd is sealed off, mostly forgotten. That\u2019s my little escape, poking through utility corridors just to see what\u2019s left running.",
      "System\u2019s been off-kilter since that Halden broadcast \u2014 half the access panels are locked one minute, open the next.",
      "All the confusion actually makes it more interesting, if not a little more tense. You double-check your exits now.",
      "I tend to keep my route quiet though. Wouldn\u2019t want too much attention, you know?"
    ],
    [
      "Story never stops \u2014 lately, I\u2019ve been spending my nights in the city\u2019s old utility tunnels. Urban exploration\u2019s what keeps me sane, tracing old data lines, listening to the city breathe beneath everyone\u2019s feet.",
      "Last week, after the Halden hologram mess, I tried a swing through Sector D\u2019s water plant. Got halfway before the guidance system told me I wasn\u2019t registered. Ten minutes later, it welcomed me inside. Anyway, made for a good story.",
      "It\u2019s strange, though \u2014 all those Predictive Assistant glitches make it harder to know if it\u2019s a real warning or just noise.",
      "Still, nothing beats walking through a silent server vault, hearing echoes where systems once sang.",
      "I stick to it because, honestly, it\u2019s the only honest space the city left me."
    ],
    [
      "That\u2019s one way to put it. For me, the real stories are under the city \u2014 sealed maintenance shafts, old data vaults, ductwork big enough to get lost in. Urban exploration\u2019s the name, and I get a real kick out of tracking which systems are still alive beneath the Council\u2019s notice.",
      "The past few weeks made it something else. Right after Halden\u2019s face started showing up everywhere, the tunnel sensors began spitting out random codes. One door welcomed me with a \u2018VIP\u2019 greeting, another locked me out entirely.",
      "You learn to move quietly and pay attention \u2014 recently, I had to pull out fast when a drone rotated my badge status twice in the same corridor. Never had that before.",
      "Still bring a flask on those nights, just sit in the silence when the lights flicker. Beats the official story any day.",
      "Even made a few repairs for fun \u2014 no one notices, but it helps keep the city going. At least for people who care to look."
    ],
    [
      "Same city, sure, but I\u2019ve always been more interested in the parts no one talks about. Urban exploration \u2014 not just for kicks, but it\u2019s a way to remember how much of Stenograd was built for people, before the system started running the show.",
      "I used to work state-side in those tunnels, knew every bolt and cable. These days, I go in for myself, headlamp and my old badge emulator \u2014 especially since all the Halden stuff started scrambling entry permissions.",
      "Last week, the system glitched so badly I got three different AI warnings in the same hallway. Ended up hiding from a patrol that probably wasn\u2019t even sure if I was supposed to exist.",
      "They say it\u2019s just the surface that matters, but you see the real soul in the forgotten places. A broken BCI alert down there means two sectors might miss their water quota, and the Council won\u2019t even notice unless I patch it for them \u2014 off the record, naturally.",
      "I share a bottle with the machines sometimes. After all, they remember what this city used to sound like when people ran things, not algorithms.",
      "If you ever want to know what Stenograd really is, don\u2019t look up. Look down. That\u2019s where you find the truth and the best stories."

      "Yeah, tunnels got noisy lately.",
      "Not much you don't already hear topside \u2014 just more of those system glitches.",
      "Used to be you could disappear down there, clear signals, no drama.",
      "Now half the panels kick out warnings, and every ten steps the system changes its mind about who should be on what level.",
      "Let's just say, it's not as quiet as it used to be."

    [
      "Yeah, got a few whispers out of them, if you can even follow the echoes with all the false alarms.",
      "Makes it tricky \u2014 one minute you're 'cleared,' next minute the dampers start shrieking evacuation orders.",
      "Ever since Halden's hologram, everything's out of sync, even below ground.",
      "Whole patch under North Complex locked me in for twenty minutes \u2014 couldn't tell if it wanted to chuck me out or log me in.",
      "Doesn't leave much room for a calm stroll these days."
    ],
    [
      "They do, actually. It's been more unpredictable lately \u2014 system glitches everywhere, even underground.",
      "Had a run-in with a guidance drone last week. Wouldn't settle on a protocol \u2014 blocked me, waved me through, then just hovered like it was waiting for instructions.",
      "Guess that's fallout from that Halden hologram mess. System can't keep its story straight, so even the forgotten corners are getting strange.",
      "Used to be, the tunnels felt outside all that, but not anymore.",
      "Makes every wander a bit of a gamble."
    ],
    [
      "Yeah, they do if you know how to listen \u2014 though it's getting harder now.",
      "Last time down by Sector 5 conduits, half the access panels blinked denial, then right back to open, like the BCI couldn't remember who I was supposed to be.",
      "Since all those Halden projections started, it's like the tunnels have nerves \u2014 random checkpoints, doors stuttering open and shut, alarms looping nonsense.",
      "It was always a bit of a dance, but now each step feels like an argument with the city itself.",
      "Still, that's half the thrill \u2014 poking around where the system's too confused to make up its mind."
    ],
    [
      "They do \u2014 though these days, you need patience. Used to be you could slip in, take your time, listen to what the city forgot.",
      "Nowadays, since the Halden hologram got out, everything underground acts half-awake. I got stuck last week between two firedoors, each giving a different warning: one telling me to evacuate, one saying shelter in place. Didn't even bother trying the system hotline \u2014 just waited with some old spirits.",
      "Funny thing, these tunnels were my quiet place\u2014off-grid, where the real city breathes. Now? I'm watching the city's crisis through the bad wiring, seeing how each Council panic ripples down the pipes before anyone above notices.",
      "Makes it feel less like exploring and more like eavesdropping on a nervous animal \u2014 and I guess I like knowing I can hear the tremors before most folks know to look up.",
      "Best part is, sometimes the glitches show paths you were never meant to find. All you need is to know when not to trust a door that opens too easily."
