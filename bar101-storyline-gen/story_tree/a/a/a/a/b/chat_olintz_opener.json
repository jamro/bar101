      "Honestly? I fold origami to keep my mind steady\u2014started years ago, back when system updates would knock out half the block and you couldn\u2019t trust the clocks.",
      "I\u2019ve got drawers of half-finished tessellations at home\u2014models from scrap that most would toss. It\u2019s the one thing that\u2019s always been mine, especially with how automated everything else is here.",
      "But since Halden\u2019s hologram hit, I barely manage a crane. The quiet\u2019s been broken\u2014fights over new scores, people swapping names in the halls, all my practice pieces piling up uneven.",
      "I even caught myself refolding the same paper three times, like I could fix things that way. Weird how what calms you becomes another reminder something\u2019s wrong.",
      "Bar 101\u2019s the only place left where the background noise doesn\u2019t match the system. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I just needed somewhere my hands could remember what normal felt like."

      "Last week I had to use protocol printouts\u2014they were everywhere after the new identity updates.",
      "People in my block have started asking about what I\u2019m making. That never used to happen.",

      "Yes, still my shield\u2014now more than ever, with the city twitching every time the Council pushes out another denial.",
      "Sometimes I fold to drown out the noise, but lately, every time a public screen glitches or there\u2019s another debate in the courtyard, I lose the pattern halfway through.",
      "I used to fold cranes from performance reports; now I keep an emergency stash of blank sheets, just in case.",

      "Yeah, definitely\u2014origami is still my shield. It was my mother\u2019s, too, during the old blackouts; she taught me during those long nights when nothing worked but your own patience.",
      "Funny, the last few weeks, after Halden\u2019s message\u2014every fold feels like it\u2019s carrying extra weight. I tried to make a modular sphere the night the hologram hit, but my hands wouldn\u2019t cooperate; I kept starting over, as if the right shape would bring order to the chaos outside.",
      "I use anything\u2014bank memos, system printouts, whatever I can grab before they\u2019re shredded. Sometimes I see Council protocols on the paper, but I fold them anyway. It\u2019s my quiet protest, I guess.",
      "Some neighbors noticed. One brought me old security forms, just so I could keep folding. We never spoke before.",
      "It\u2019s odd\u2014these small things we cling to. Paper, folds, memory\u2014while the rest of the city unravels, I guess I just need something I can still bend into place."
