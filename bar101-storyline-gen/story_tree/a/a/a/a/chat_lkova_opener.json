      "Still spinning, yeah. Not my problem, mostly.",

      "Was out for a walk underground, nothing fancy.",
      "Place locked up tighter than usual after all the noise about sabotage. Got stuck by a scanner. Not much fun now.",

      "City\u2019s still ticking over, for whatever that\u2019s worth.",
      "I stick to my routes. Urban exploration, mostly \u2014 check the tunnels, old service corridors.",
      "Been doing it for years. Most folks don\u2019t notice. Good way to see which parts of the city are actually alive.",
      "Last weekend, got held up by security after that big leak. Guess everyone\u2019s jumpy.",
      "Suppose I\u2019ll lay low until things settle out."

      "Spinning, stalling, fits and starts \u2014 take your pick these days.",
      "You know my thing\u2019s urban exploration, right? Crawling through old utility tunnels, backup generator rooms, abandoned control points.",
      "Just last week, they blocked off my favorite tunnel in Sector 12. Some scanner flagged me \u2014 never happened before, not in all my wandering.",
      "Had to wait half an hour while security ran checks. Used to be you just waved your badge and moved on.",
      "These sabotage scares tighten everything down. Takes some of the fun out of it."

    [
      "Still turning on its axis, but feeling shakier by the day.",
      "Honestly, my real escape\u2019s always been exploring what\u2019s left under the city. Not official, not pretty \u2014 poking through sealed networks, forgotten walkways, spot of homebrew to keep things interesting.",
      "Tried going down below Sector 12 last weekend but got stopped cold \u2014 new badge locks after that sabotage mess. Two security types, wanted my whole life story.",
      "Even the air feels different down there now, like the place remembers being watched.",
      "Maybe paranoid times just turn every hobby into a risk."
    ],
    [
      "Oh, it\u2019s spinning, all right, but if you get low enough, the noise drops off. That\u2019s half my hobby \u2014 urban spelunking where the old city still hums. Must be the ex-systems engineer in me \u2014 I\u2019ve been crawling tunnels and bypassing shut doors since I could walk.",
      "I usually know which pipes rattle, when to duck a sensor, how the rust smells on different levels. Used to be just me, the echo, and a flash of homebrew in my pocket.",
      "Now, since Halden\u2019s curtain call and all those sabotage rumors, security\u2019s gone into lockdown. Got stopped last week in Sector 12 by a scanner that never cared before. Directorate boots showed up, grilled me for an hour. Felt like the pipes were listening too.",
      "Guess exploring\u2019s gotten less about what you find and more about who finds you.",
      "Weird thing is, even locked out, I know those tunnels better than most of the new admin teams. I can still hear the city breathing, if I listen close."

      "Yeah, took a walk through Sector 12\u2019s tunnels last night.",

      "Got flagged going in. Never happened before \u2014 shows how rattled things are.",
      "Used to have the run of the deeper ducts, but that\u2019s risky now.",
      "Still, it\u2019s good for the nerves, if you pick your moments carefully."

      "Yeah, I was out again. Old utility corridors, you know the type \u2014 half-lit, damp, always humming.",
      "Had some Directorate fellas stop me, all because of this sabotage paranoia. Not the usual nighttime banter.",
      "Funny, used to be you could wander those stretches if you minded your step. Now, every badge beep gets attention.",
      "After Halden went, seems like the city assumes we\u2019re all up to something.",
      "Still find it calming, between all the lockdowns. Beats stewing above ground."

      "Urban exploration, yeah. That\u2019s my break from all the algorithmic nonsense. Always preferred pipes and relays to boardroom drama.",
      "Since the Halden fallout and the BCI shocks, they\u2019ve got Directorate crawling everywhere \u2014 even old haunts.",
      "Got pinned for \u2018review\u2019 after a scanner flagged my creds last time \u2014 all because of the sabotage chatter.",
      "The deeper tunnels aren\u2019t just hobby spots anymore. City\u2019s mood down there\u2019s gone sour: sensors talking to each other, patrols twitchy as kicked dogs.",
      "Honestly, I miss when the only thing buzzing in those ducts was bad wiring and not rumors of Council backstabs. Still, few places left where I can think straight, so I keep at it where I can."
