  "outcome": "Three days after the graffiti gatherings, Stenograd wakes up to a citywide blackout of BCI scores. People lose access to their ratings: public transport, job sites, and housing entry grind to chaos. Manual processes take their place, and trust in the Council shatters as frantic factions scramble for new authority. Secret logs reveal Halden planned for this as a 'resilience test.' As weeks pass, Council members are forced into open debate with citizens, for the first time in years.",
