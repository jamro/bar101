  "title": "The Lintz Disclosure",
  "story_summary": "In the tightly controlled city of Stenograd, where the enigmatic Behavioral Compliance Index quietly ruled daily life, everything began to unravel after Marek Halden - the BCI's creator - died mysteriously. At dawn, a shifting graffiti near the central station mesmerized the public, its pattern echoing Halden's original BCI design and stoking myths of hidden messages and secret oversight. As rumors spread and nightly crowds swelled, the city's fragile trust collapsed, pushing Council factions into fierce conflict while reformers like Oksana Lintz fueled debates about the system's true purpose. The crisis deepened when a sudden blackout cut access to everyone's scores, plunging Stenograd into chaos and forcing council members to finally face citizens honestly in heated public assemblies. Neighborhoods broke free, creating their own rules, but old wounds surfaced as BCI records reemerged, sparking new tensions. Ultimately, pressured by outrage, Oksana released the full archive of systemic abuses, igniting citywide reckoning, truth commissions, and the abolition of the BCI - shattering the old order and opening the door for genuine justice and a uncertain, hard-won freedom.",
