  "story_summary": "In the tightly controlled city of Stenograd, where lives are steered by the hidden algorithms of the Behavioral Compliance Index, everything changes the day a glowing graffiti - bearing the mysterious schematic of the BCI's original design - appears near the central transit station. As dawn and dusk reveal its shifting pattern, citizens flock to see it, sparking rumors that its creator, the late Marek Halden, left behind a hidden message of reform. Council factions clash: some demand study, some insist on erasure, while others fear the birth of dangerous myths. When activist Oksana Lintz leaks her own interpretation, crowds swell and trust in the system shatters. Three days later, the city plunges into chaos as BCI scores vanish overnight, forcing residents and leaders to talk, argue, and improvise in a landscape suddenly stripped of automated order. With newfound debates and neighborhood assemblies rising, Stenograd's citizens seize the chance to shape their own rules, even as old loyalties and buried records threaten to drag old injustices back into the light. As disorder and hope contend, the city stumbles - uncertain, but newly alive with possibility.",
