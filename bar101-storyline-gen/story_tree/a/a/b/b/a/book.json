  "content": "In 2025\u2019s Stenograd, life flows under the invisible hand of the Behavioral Compliance Index, a system built by Marek Halden to quietly guide every citizen\u2019s choices\u2014until Halden is found dead and the city\u2019s careful order begins to unravel. At sunrise, shifting graffiti appears near the central station, echoing the schematic of Halden\u2019s original BCI\u2014and sparking a storm of rumors, factional infighting, and nightly gatherings as people question everything about their world. As Innovators and Directorate leaders squabble over control, Oksana Lintz fans the flames by suggesting Halden meant the graffiti as a signal for citizen oversight. Public trust collapses, protests erupt, and finally, a daring insider, Sven Halek, plunges the city into chaos by disabling BCI scores\u2014forcing citizens and the once-distant Council into raw, open debate. For the first time in years, neighbors and leaders speak face-to-face, grappling with the uncertainty and possibility that comes when an all-seeing system finally falters, and Stenograd begins to dream of new ways to govern itself."
