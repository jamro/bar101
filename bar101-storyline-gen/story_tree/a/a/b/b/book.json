As whispers ignite and crowds gather, Innovators urge careful study of this anomaly, the hardline Directorate demands its swift erasure, and the cautious Harmonists fear myth and unrest.

Protests swell and trust in the all-seeing system crumbles, as the city\u2019s tightly woven order unravels and the specter of hidden reform beckons from Halden\u2019s spectral, sunlit blueprint."
