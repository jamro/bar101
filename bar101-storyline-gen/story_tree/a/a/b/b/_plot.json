Some factions claim it's vandalism, others a sign from Halden himself. The Council is divided: Innovators urge study, Directorate demands its erasure, and the Harmonists worry about myths spiraling out of control. As the artifact draws nightly crowds and feverish speculation, public trust in the BCI's origin story collapses. Oksana leaks her own reading of the design, fueling a movement for citizen oversight, while the Directorate instigates harsh crackdowns.",
