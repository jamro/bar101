  "trigger_event": "After neighborhoods start rewriting their own scoring systems, Rada is given exclusive leaks: the Council plans a citywide 'calibration' to restore order, while citizens flood her with evidence of past abuses and secrets around Halden's death. Rada, shaken by a late-night confidant\u2019s advice, realizes the story she breaks next could tip the city toward either fragile calm or explosive reckoning.",
  "dilemma": "Should Rada use her media reach to spotlight the Council\u2019s citywide calibration plan and encourage people to accept restored services (risking a return to quiet control), or expose the avalanche of hidden evidence, calling for public citizen juries and risking chaos for the chance at real justice?",
  "reason": "Rada knows her decision will set the city\u2019s tone: official calm or raw confrontation. Her job lets her shape public attention, but the wrong move could unleash violence or harden oppression. Conversations with Alex, who urges her to weigh the city\u2019s need for hope against its hunger for the truth, leave her torn.",
