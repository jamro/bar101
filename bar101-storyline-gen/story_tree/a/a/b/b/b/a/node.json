  "title": "Calibration Campaign",
  "story_summary": "In 2025, Stenograd's calm, automated order shatters when its creator, Marek Halden, dies mysteriously, leaving the city's Behavioral Compliance Index faltering and the Council powerless. As system failures breed confusion, Sven Halek, seeing both danger and opportunity, quietly encourages trusted locals to rewrite their own rules. Inspired by leaked logs, a coalition of residents and technicians hacks their district's algorithm, sparking a wave of grassroots experiments - some districts abolish scores, others embrace newfound autonomy, and festivity swells in the streets while the Council loses its grip. Tensions erupt as the Council tries to restore control with subtle digital nudges and promises of normalcy, but hints of Halden's hidden manipulations fuel public suspicion. Neighborhoods fracture between cautious acceptance and rebellious defiance, secret meetings multiply, and the once-uniform capital transforms into a patchwork of rival systems - uncertain, lively, and forever changed.",
