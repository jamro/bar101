  "title": "The Score Uprising",
  "outcome": "In the wake of leaked audits and graffiti, neighborhoods traumatized by erratic BCI scoring unite to take matters into their own hands. Residents and technicians collaborate to rewrite their local scoring algorithms, breaking away from city control. Some districts become testbeds for radical egalitarianism; others fall under rule of new 'citizen scores.' The Council is paralyzed as their influence wanes, and Stenograd is transformed by cascading acts of rebellion, creativity, and new local codes.",
