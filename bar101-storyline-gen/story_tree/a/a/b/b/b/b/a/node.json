  "title": "Memory Day Uprising",
  "story_summary": "In 2025, the city of Stenograd is tightly ruled by the Behavioral Compliance Index, a system that silently shapes every life - until its architect, Marek Halden, dies mysteriously, sending the city's machine-run order into disarray. Courageous insider Rada Miskovic refuses the Council's plan to hide the truth, instead broadcasting explosive evidence that sparks a wave of citizen juries investigating BCI abuses and Council cover-ups live for all to see. As testimonies clash and hidden secrets surface, public outrage swells, forcing Council factions to leak even deeper truths in a desperate bid for control - only to fracture their own legitimacy. Amid the unrest, elder Nikola Petrak halts BCI scoring, declaring a 'Memory Day' for citizens to reflect and share their suppressed stories. The days that follow unite thousands, as the people - finally heard - come together in open assemblies to reject automated rule. When the Council tries to restore its system, Stenograd's residents stand firm, refusing compliance and reclaiming their collective agency, ushering in a new era shaped by human hands and voices rather than algorithms.",
