  "title": "Public Justice Hearings",
  "outcome": "Citizen juries are established in several neighborhoods to publicly review both local records and the Council's recent actions. The most anticipated hearing targets a former Council official over BCI-related denials and Halden\u2019s death cover-up. Livestreamed deliberations expose contradictory testimonies and ignite a surge of leaked evidence. As protests grow, Council factions leak even older secrets to manipulate outcomes, inadvertently eroding their own legitimacy. Citizens experience a sense of justice but divisions are stoked citywide.",
