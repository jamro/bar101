  "content": "In 2025, the city of Stenograd is tightly ruled by the Behavioral Compliance Index, a system that silently shapes every life\u2014until its architect, Marek Halden, dies mysteriously, sending the city's machine-run order into disarray. Courageous insider Rada Miskovic refuses the Council\u2019s plan to hide the truth, instead broadcasting explosive evidence that sparks a wave of citizen juries investigating BCI abuses and Council cover-ups live for all to see. As testimonies clash and hidden secrets surface, public outrage swells, forcing Council factions to leak even deeper truths in a desperate bid for control\u2014only to fracture their own legitimacy. Amid the unrest, elder Nikola Petrak halts BCI scoring, declaring a \u201cMemory Day\u201d for citizens to reflect and share their suppressed stories. The days that follow unite thousands, as the people\u2014finally heard\u2014come together in open assemblies to reject automated rule. When the Council tries to restore its system, Stenograd\u2019s residents stand firm, refusing compliance and reclaiming their collective agency, ushering in a new era shaped by human hands and voices rather than algorithms."
