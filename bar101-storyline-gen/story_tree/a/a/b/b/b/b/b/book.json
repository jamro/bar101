  "content": "In 2025\u2019s tightly controlled Stenograd, daily life is shaped by the Behavioral Compliance Index\u2014a system that silently directs access and opportunity. When its architect, Marek Halden, dies mysteriously and subsystems begin to fail, frustration and unrest sweep the city. Seizing the moment, Nikola Petrak rallies public support for citizen juries to investigate the BCI\u2019s abuses. Testimony reveals secret wrongdoings and a hidden fail-safe engineered by Halden: if evidence of harm is made public, the BCI will self-destruct. Amid mounting outrage, the juries declare the system guilty, triggering a final broadcast of apology before the BCI vanishes. Order collapses, but as confusion gives way to determination, grassroots assemblies quickly rise to govern, drawing Stenograd into a new era of community-driven freedom."
