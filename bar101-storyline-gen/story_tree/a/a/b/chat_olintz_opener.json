      "I ruined half my crane stack last night from trembling hands.",
      "Sometimes I imagine every shape I fold gets flagged\u2014ridiculous, I know, but paranoia\u2019s... viral here.",
      "Even my old pattern files triggered a security alert today.",
      "But the folding helps. It\u2019s a private logic\u2014something I can control, even when nothing else makes sense."

      "Yeah, actually. I finished a modular star on the tram earlier today.",

      "Every piece I fold at home, I worry it\u2019s tracked in my profile.",
      "Even simple cranes feel risky with all the BCI paranoia around.",
      "Still, it\u2019s an anchor\u2014paper, geometry, pure process. Reminds me I\u2019m not just running patterns for the system.",
      "If I stop folding... I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s left of me apart from compliance metrics."
