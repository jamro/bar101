  "content": "In the hyper-controlled city of Stenograd, life is quietly shaped by the Behavioral Compliance Index\u2014a system that rewards obedience and punishes dissent, all managed by unseen algorithms and their architect, Marek Halden. When Halden dies mysteriously, his passing destabilizes the city\u2019s intricate order; functions begin to fail, and cracks open in the Council's once-iron grip. Taking advantage of official silence, marginalized residents courageously declare themselves \u201cscoreless,\u201d rejecting the BCI and forming their own networks for housing, markets, and clinics. As these parallel communities flourish, the government attempts crackdowns, but glitches and mass public support\u2014fueled by unexpected endorsements from figures like Oksana and Rada\u2014make resistance unstoppable. Government offices empty as resignations surge, and for the first time in years, Stenograd feels a wild, hopeful pulse as citizens reshape their city beyond the reach of the system."
