As Daria Tomenko risks everything to save erased testimonies, citizen panels seize the chance to pull secret abuses into the light. When \u2018invisible citizens\u2019 and whistleblowers bravely testify, outrage erupts, trust splinters, and once-powerful Council factions publicly turn on each other. Debates and citywide trials sweep Stenograd, forcing people to choose between justice and forgiveness. United by truth, citizens push forward, drafting a transparent new city charter and reclaiming their future from the algorithms that once ruled them."
