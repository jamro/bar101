  "trigger_event": "The eruption of interactive citywide broadcasts and the revelation of hidden 'ghost citizen' archives force residents to search for new sources of truth and leadership. Competing grassroots groups urge Rada to use her platform to either unite the city through the mythic Halden Echoes oracle or rally support for a breakaway neighborhood's self-governing experiment.",
  "dilemma": "Rada must choose whether to endorse the creation of a unifying civic oracle based on the myth of Halden Echoes, or to publicly champion the first neighborhood's bold break from the BCI, setting a precedent for wider rebellion.",
  "reason": "Rada knows her voice will legitimize whichever path she chooses. She is torn between offering hope and unity with the oracle, or sparking real, risky change by endorsing the breakaway neighborhood. Her conversations with Alex, who challenges her to consider the weight of her influence on either outcome, deepen her uncertainty.",
  "choice_a": "Embrace and help launch the Halden Echoes oracle as a trusted civic guide for the confused city.",
  "belief_a": [
    "A unifying symbol can focus resistance without immediate chaos.",
    "Collective imagination is power, especially in uncertain times.",
    "If people share a vision, they will hesitate before tearing each other apart."

  "choice_b": "Give public backing to the breakaway neighborhood, legitimizing and encouraging BCI-free, self-governed zones.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Change must happen in the streets, not just in stories.",
    "People claim real freedom only by taking real risks.",
    "A single bold act can push others to break their silence."
