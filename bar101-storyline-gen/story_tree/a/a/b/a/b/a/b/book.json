As the Council scrambles to steady the city, Lenart Kova, devoted to healing and redemption, hijacks the crisis, funneling raw BCI data into a powerful oracle. In a single stunning broadcast, each resident is shown visions of alternate lives\u2014trajectories shaped by different choices or scores\u2014sparking nights of collective storytelling and honesty across Stenograd. Council members, faced with their own painful revelations, confess and reflect alongside the city, igniting a wave of truth-telling and accountability. Gradually, the city shifts from algorithmic control to shared understanding, and, through weeks of open debate, Stenograd reins in the BCI\u2019s grasp, pioneering a new era of transparent, participatory justice that begins to heal old wounds and imagine new futures."
