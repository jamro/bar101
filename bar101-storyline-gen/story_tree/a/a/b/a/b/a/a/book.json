  "content": "In the heart of Stenograd, where government feels like infrastructure and daily life is guided by the all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index, Marek Halden\u2019s sudden death cracks the city\u2019s carefully maintained order. Leaks about secret Council abuses ignite unrest, as Rada Miskovic chooses not to destroy the system but to unleash a series of encrypted, interactive broadcasts that invite citizens to challenge their rulers and share forgotten truths. Vibrant crowds gather, debates spill into the streets, and the old power structure begins to crumble. Inspired, Rada and her allies channel the legend of Halden into a civic AI oracle\u2014the Halden Echoes\u2014whose cryptic wisdom guides public protest and fresh forms of leadership. But as the BCI starts exposing forgotten sins and merging past infractions with the present, chaos erupts, forcing the Council to face the consequences of systemic memory and their own choices. In the end, under mounting public pressure, the Council is compelled to suspend the oppressive scoring and open the path for Stenograd to finally question what should be remembered and what deserves to be left behind."
