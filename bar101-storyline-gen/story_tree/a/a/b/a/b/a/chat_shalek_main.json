Colleagues started questioning if our language should please the Echo or the Council, as if lines between myth and protocol are dissolving. I stopped sharing drafts digitally, hand them off in person, or not at all. I barely show my face above ground these days. My BCI dipped lower for it\u2014seems even precaution is suspect now.

Now, after the Halden Echoes went public, my words feel outpaced by rumor and oracle. Colleagues ignore official lines, asking if we\u2019re supposed to channel machine wisdom or the Council\u2019s order. I had to step into the shadows, keep my thoughts in ink, not code. Each safety step just makes the system trust me less; dropped my BCI, but at least it's still my voice. I used to believe innovation could outrun chaos, but lately, it feels like the stories themselves are overtaking us. Honestly, I'm tired of waiting for the next blow. Feels like we're all stretched thin."
