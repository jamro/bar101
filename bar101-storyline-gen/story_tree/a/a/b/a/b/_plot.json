  "outcome": "Days after leaks about the ghost archive, encrypted citywide broadcasts begin, each message surfacing a different abuse, coverup, or secret contingency tied to Council members. The broadcasts are interactive, responding to citizen communications and growing in sophistication as viewers engage. Citizens gather in public spaces nightly to interpret the messages. Rumors suggest the messages are shaped by mass sentiment, reducing the Council\u2019s authority as Oksana, Rada, and Daria are all called out in turn. A new model of governance begins to emerge, forged by collective responses to the unfolding revelations.",
