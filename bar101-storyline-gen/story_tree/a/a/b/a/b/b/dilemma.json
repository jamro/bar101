  "dilemma": "Sven Halek must choose between broadcasting Halden\u2019s spiral blueprint\u2014unleashing a unifying symbol for collective renewal\u2014or airing the suppressed stories of the 'ghost' users, confronting the city with painful revelations about its hidden past. Only one message can be trusted to shape the next chapter of Stenograd.",
  "reason": "Both options could remake the city, but only one message can lead right now without causing chaos or paralyzing the city. Sven\u2019s instincts, sharpened by late-night debates with Alex the bartender, point in opposite directions\u2014one toward hope and new myth, the other toward late justice. The choice will define his reputation, the city\u2019s emotional weather, and which factions rise or fall.",
