  "title": "The Spiral Opened",
  "story_summary": "In 2025, the city of Stenograd runs on invisible lines of control, where the Behavioral Compliance Index (BCI) quietly shapes everyone's fate. When Marek Halden, the architect of this system, is found dead and the city's algorithms begin to fray, journalist Rada Miskovic boldly backs a neighborhood's decision to break free from the BCI, sparking a wave of grassroots self-governance. The experiment flourishes - stress dwindles, citizen voices rise - and soon, more neighborhoods follow, fracturing centralized power. Amid this upheaval, technician Sven Halek reveals Halden's original spiral blueprint for the BCI, a symbol of open-ended growth and shared responsibility. Inspired, the people rally together in assemblies and rituals, dissolving old hierarchies. On the Night of the Spirals, murals blossom citywide as the last vestiges of the Council vanish, and Stenograd embraces a new era of collective ascent, guided by Halden's legacy and a vision of hope rekindled from the chaos.",
