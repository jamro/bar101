      "You could say that. I restore and study prohibited political works\u2014call it nostalgia. Used to find rare pamphlets online, now resources vanish overnight. Last week, access froze right as a zone cut BCI ties. City security notices now flash even in private collections. Makes it feel more like contraband again."

      "Yes, it\u2019s been a stretch. I collect, restore, and annotate suppressed political books\u2014my peculiar taste. The recent independence wave made researching much riskier. Last night, I lost access to a rare foreign archive, just vanished. Even my own offline notes are under \u2018integrity review\u2019 by the system. I keep print copies, but reading them feels more dangerous each week. Strangely energizing, in a way."

      "Feels endless. I\u2019ve kept banned works since before the BCI\u2014pamphlets, manifestos, trial transcripts. After the free zones broke away, city archives started restricting content, even historical texts. The system monitors every query, so I\u2019ve built a mirror library underground\u2014paranoia, perhaps. Spent hours digitizing last week, before another archive vanished. Watching forbidden ideas disappear makes me catalog each annotation by hand, like it might outlast the city. Some nights I imagine losing every word, as if history itself were dissolving around me."
