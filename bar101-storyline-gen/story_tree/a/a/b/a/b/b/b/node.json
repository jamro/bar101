  "title": "The Ghosts' Testimony",
  "story_summary": "In the silent city of Stenograd, where algorithmic governance quietly shaped every life, everything changed when Sven Halek made a fateful choice: he aired the hidden testimonies of the 'ghost' users - residents erased and punished by the all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index. As their stories of Council abuse echoed citywide, outrage erupted, and crowds flooded public forums, demanding truth and forgiveness. Moderated by Rada and Daria, open hearings forced officials to confront buried injustices and admit past failures, including Council members like Oksana. Tensions peaked as citywide assemblies debated Stenograd's future, but in a historic act of unity, citizens approved a sweeping amnesty for all but the worst offenders. As Halden's last words - 'Truth grows in the open' - illuminated the city, Stenograd sealed its old archives and began anew, reborn from confession and hope.",
