  "dilemma": "Daria must decide whether to expose the secret archive of 'ghost' BCI users to the Council, risking chaos but forcing the truth into the open, or to destroy the evidence of the ghost archive and instead amplify the mysterious symbol that has begun captivating the public.",
  "reason": "Daria knows that revealing the ghost profiles will cause panic and possibly endanger herself due to her own low BCI score, while amplifying the symbol could channel unrest into hopeful myth but bury real system faults. Alex, the bartender, challenges her: 'What does the city need more\u2014brutal honesty, or something to believe in?'",
