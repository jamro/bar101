As his power grew, Halden locked down access, centralized authority, and made changes in secret\u2014until, without warning, he was found dead in his sealed residence. The heart of the city\u2019s order skipped a beat: automated systems glitched, privileges vanished, and suspicion filled the vacuum left by Halden\u2019s absence.

Soon, a massive leak exposed private BCI scores and officials\u2019 secrets, igniting public fury and widespread unrest. As the city convulsed with protests and chaos, hidden records emerged, proving that the seeds of Stenograd\u2019s collapse had been sown by Halden long before his mysterious death."
