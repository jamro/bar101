  "title": "The Scapegoat Loop",
  "story_summary": "In the tightly controlled city of Stenograd, Marek Halden reigned as the architect behind the Behavioral Compliance Index, a vast system quietly judging every citizen's life and choices. As his power grew, Halden locked down access, centralized authority, and made changes in secret - until, without warning, he was found dead in his sealed residence. The heart of the city's order skipped a beat: automated systems glitched, privileges vanished, and suspicion filled the vacuum left by Halden's absence. Desperate for control, Council factions feuded while technician Oksana Lintz rushed a quick fix, not knowing it would open the floodgates. Soon, a massive leak exposed private BCI scores and officials' secrets, igniting public fury and widespread unrest. As the city convulsed with protests and chaos, hidden records emerged, proving that the seeds of Stenograd's collapse had been sown by Halden long before his mysterious death.",
