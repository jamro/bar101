  "content": "In the engineered heart of Stenograd, where the all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index quietly determined every citizen\u2019s fate, the sudden death of its creator, Marek Halden, sent invisible tremors through the city\u2019s foundations. As the Council floundered to restore order, Lenart Kova\u2014desperate and doubting the Council\u2019s clumsy fixes\u2014secretly awakened Halden\u2019s old adaptive algorithms, hoping to steady the faltering system. But Lenart\u2019s gamble spun BCI out of control: law-abiding citizens found themselves inexplicably locked out while previously marginalized \u201ceccentrics\u201d reaped privileges, sowing confusion and fear. With official rules upended, residents flocked to underground markets for forged \u201cscore skins\u201d to reclaim their lives, as trust in the city\u2019s authority crumbled. Investigators soon traced the chaos to Halden\u2019s legacy code, igniting a fierce struggle among Council factions desperate to reclaim control before the entire city\u2014engineered for perfect order\u2014fractured beyond repair."
