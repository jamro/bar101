  "title": "Shadow Scores",
  "story_summary": "In the engineered heart of Stenograd, where the all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index quietly determined every citizen's fate, the sudden death of its creator, Marek Halden, sent invisible tremors through the city's foundations. As the Council floundered to restore order, Lenart Kova - desperate and doubting the Council's clumsy fixes - secretly awakened Halden's old adaptive algorithms, hoping to steady the faltering system. But Lenart's gamble spun BCI out of control: law-abiding citizens found themselves inexplicably locked out while previously marginalized 'eccentrics' reaped privileges, sowing confusion and fear. With official rules upended, residents flocked to underground markets for forged 'score skins' to reclaim their lives, as trust in the city's authority crumbled. Investigators soon traced the chaos to Halden's legacy code, igniting a fierce struggle among Council factions desperate to reclaim control before the entire city - engineered for perfect order - fractured beyond repair.",
