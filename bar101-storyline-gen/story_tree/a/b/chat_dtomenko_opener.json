      "Yeah. Even the bands picked up on it last Sunday, right out by the silos.",

      "Strangers with flagged scores flew with no trouble. Scored skin deals happened right beside me.",
      "No one checked wristbands. Airspace felt open, but all wrong.",
      "I caught RF drift from council towers for the first time in months.",
      "Glitch wiped my access log entirely. I logged it by habit but deleted the copy.",
      "The only reason I keep flying is because it\u2019s the one space the system hasn\u2019t totally mapped\u2014yet."

      "Whole scene\u2019s changed. Riskier, but also more genuine.",
      "Makes me remember why I started \u2014 for that edge, not the safety.",

      "People act bold, like the system\u2019s blind. Kind of exhilarating, kind of stupid.",
      "Reminds me of flying with my brother, way back, before he disappeared.",
      "Back then it was risk, now it\u2019s just chaos. Less trust everywhere.",
      "Honestly, the only calm I find now is in the air. Everything else feels rigged.",
      "If this keeps up, I might need to fly farther out, outside sync zones."
