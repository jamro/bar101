  "outcome": "Restored 'ghost' citizens organize the first public tribunal since the BCI's inception, demanding Council figures account for years of disappearances, score manipulation, and privilege abuses. As crowds rally and testimonies flood the city, public memory resurfaces and fractures deepen between Council factions. Oksana Lintz is forced to reveal the technical secrets behind erasure and restoration protocols as Directorate operatives try to sabotage the proceedings, but Harmonists counter with exposure of past cover-ups.",
