  "outcome": "Three days after mass Council resignations, the BCI automatically triggers a 'reset protocol,' erasing all individual compliance scores and special privileges. Social order fractures but also democratizes, as residents rebuild society outside digital rankings. The city's cohesion is tested and reinvented, while a posthumous message from Halden reframes his death as a deliberate act to force this reset. The long-term future becomes uncertain, but powered by hope instead of surveillance.",
