  "title": "Transparency Spiral",
  "story_summary": "In 2025, Stenograd's citizens live beneath the gaze of the all-powerful Behavioral Compliance Index, a system that quietly shapes every aspect of life and rewards loyalty while erasing those who step out of line. But when system architect Marek Halden dies mysteriously, cracks appear in the city's seamless control. Oksana Lintz, a determined administrator, risks everything to restore the 'ghosts' - people the BCI had disappeared - throwing the city into turmoil as these untracked figures unsettle routines and expose hidden flaws. Protests swell when a charred ledger surfaces, revealing Council elites have long enjoyed secret privileges, igniting outrage over corruption. As public anger boils and factions within the Council clash, the restored ghosts organize Stenograd's first tribunal, forcing leaders like Oksana to reveal secrets of the BCI's erasures. Finally, radical transparency floods the city, but instead of peace, it breeds paralyzing suspicion, leaving Stenograd suspended in mistrust and uncertainty.",
