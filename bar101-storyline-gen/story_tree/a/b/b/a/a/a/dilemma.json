People are leaderless and frightened, rumors spread, and Oksana\u2014haunted by her recent night talks with Alex\u2014stands before the system's last remaining override terminal.",
  "dilemma": "Oksana must decide: erase everyone's BCI scores, forcing a clean slate and unpredictable freedom, or permanently shield the 'ghosts' and chaos agents from tracking, cementing an era of secrecy and unchecked sabotage.",
  "reason": "Both choices terrify Oksana; one means giving up all control and trusting the city to rebuild itself, the other unleashes secrets and hidden actors forever. Her job was always to analyze risk, not pick which future would be born from chaos.",
  "choice_a": "Erase all BCI scores, wiping both privilege and stigma from the system, so all citizens must face each other equally and invent new ways to live.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Fresh starts give people the power to define justice for themselves.",
    "Control without trust breeds only resentment and collapse.",
    "Hope is born when old hierarchies vanish, even if it means chaos."

  "choice_b": "Activate permanent invisibility for the 'ghosts,' letting them hide, disrupt, and leak untraceably, cementing a future where trust can never be total.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Hidden actors are the only check against total control.",
    "Exposing everyone can quickly turn to mob rule and witch hunts.",
    "Without some secrets, real change is impossible\u2014only surveillance reshaped."
