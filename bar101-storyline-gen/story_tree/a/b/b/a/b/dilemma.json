  "trigger_event": "With the city on edge after the puzzle hunt and exposed BCI abuses, the Council announces a sudden public vote on the new protocol, just as a severe heatwave threatens to overwhelm city infrastructure.",
  "dilemma": "Should Rada use her broadcast authority to rally the city around the Council\u2019s vote on BCI reform\u2014even as she suspects it\u2019s a sham\u2014or refuse, choosing instead to help citizens organize outside the system as the city slips toward chaos?",
  "reason": "Rada fears legitimizing another hollow gesture might make things worse, but refusing to participate could mean losing her last influence over how events unfold\u2014and putting herself in direct conflict with the system. Her recent conversations with Alex leave her torn between the power of collective spectacle and the promise of ground-up action.",
  "choice_a": "Champion and broadcast the citywide vote as a historic turning point, hoping mass participation will force real change or at least reveal the vote as a farce.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Mass engagement, even if manipulated, can crack open official secrets.",
    "Exposing corruption from the inside is her duty as a journalist.",
    "Only visible, collective action can shake citizens from apathy."

  "choice_b": "Refuse to support the vote; instead, funnel resources and information to neighborhoods forming their own energy-sharing and decision-making collectives as the BCI fails.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Change that isn't built in the streets dies in the broadcast booth.",
    "Real power lies in neighbors helping each other, not in official ceremonies.",
    "Sometimes, the only honest choice is to ignore the stage and light your own fire."
