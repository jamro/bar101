  "outcome": "A mysterious protocol embedded by Halden merges fragments of old BCI routines with resident data and histories, causing boundaries between citizen categories and personal narratives to blur. As neighborhood assemblies step up to make sense of confusion and sudden empathy between former adversaries, the Council faces a choice: risk everything to reset the city or accept the emergent, collective-led order. Halden's intent is revealed as a gamble on shared humanity rather than surveillance.",
