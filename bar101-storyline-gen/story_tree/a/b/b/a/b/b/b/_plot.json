  "outcome": "A concealed failsafe triggers a two-week countdown to total BCI shutdown unless a new protocol is agreed by Council and neighborhoods. Panic pushes cross-group leaders like Oksana, Lenart, and Rada to collaborate using assemblies and public debate. They produce a radically inclusive charter just before the deadline, fundamentally transforming Stenograd's governance. Halden's death is reframed as careful preparation for collective self-rule, not loss of control.",
