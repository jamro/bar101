While officials struggled for control, journalist Rada Miskovic quietly defied the Council by empowering neighborhoods to organize their own energy and resource sharing, sparking a wave of grassroots cooperation that bridged divides between high and low scorers. As the system faltered further, a hidden protocol Halden left behind began blurring personal histories and compliance boundaries, unexpectedly fostering empathy and solidarity among former adversaries. Despite Council threats of a crackdown, local assemblies embraced the new collective spirit, organizing citywide dialogues that transformed confusion into hope. Ultimately, the people of Stenograd chose to keep their emerging, empathic order, and, with Rada\u2019s help, Halden\u2019s final act was revealed\u2014a wager on the city\u2019s shared humanity over surveillance, fulfilled in the unity that followed."
