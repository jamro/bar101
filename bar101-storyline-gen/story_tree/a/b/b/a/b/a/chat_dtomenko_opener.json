      "Dodged system noise more than trouble. I fly freestyle drones, mostly out in old industrial zones. Noticed more pilots around since the BCI vote scandal. Feeds are scrambled, but nobody\u2019s stopping us now. It\u2019s the only place that feels clear. Power feels different when nothing\u2019s tracking you."

      "Yeah, dodged the usual static. I like to fly FPV drones\u2014freestyle, nothing competitive. The yards are my spot, but recently, loads more people came out after that vote leak. Airwaves were a mess, but security stopped caring. For a few hours, the rules just... dropped away. Nearest thing to actual freedom here."

    [
      "Feels like dodging is all anyone does now. My escape is flying FPV drones\u2014lost my brother, so now I stick to rooftops, yards, whatever\u2019s offline. After the vote leak, every pilot was out, running signal jammers, acting like system eyes were blind. Security skipped patrols\u2014no one reading the feeds. I\u2019ve never seen that. Made me think what tracking really does to people. Raw, strange feeling\u2014almost hopeful, but risky if anyone\u2019s still logging flights."
