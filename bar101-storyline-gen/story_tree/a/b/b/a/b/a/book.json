Using her privileged access, she secretly launches Halden\u2019s hidden 'redemption protocol': a citywide puzzle hunt that draws together citizens from every walk of life\u2014favored elites, suppressed dissenters, even once-erased 'ghosts'\u2014as clues blossom in murals and encrypted signs across the city. United by curiosity and hope, people overcome old divisions, forcing the authorities to scramble and fail in their attempts at censorship. When the final clue reveals a new protocol that would let residents shape governance through consensus, fervent debate fills Stenograd\u2019s streets, culminating in a public vote hailed as a turning point. But the promise shatters when insiders leak proof that votes were rigged to favor the obedient and powerful, fueling outrage, digital revolts, and a deep new rift between the people and their silent rulers, leaving the city at a crossroads between control and genuine self-determination."
