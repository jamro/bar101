      "Some days, my clearance goes higher than I deserve. Other days, nothing works.",
      "During my last flight, I drifted through an unlisted test corridor. Didn\u2019t get flagged, just glitched telemetry.",
      "There are old faces, new pilots, and signals I haven\u2019t seen in a year.",
      "It\u2019s chaotic, but kind of freeing. Like the system lost its sense of order.",
      "Makes me think about what control even means in this city.",
      "Mostly, I just chase clear air, hope nothing tracks me home."
