  "trigger_event": "As BCI privileges vanish, public assemblies and daily services teeter on collapse. Kova is pressured by civic organizers to enable open communication, while Directorate loyalists demand he withhold evidence of sabotage and suppress unrest.",
  "dilemma": "Should Kova unlock secure communications for open civic assemblies, sparking mass mobilization, or conceal evidence and focus on quiet repairs to protect fragile order?",
  "reason": "Kova knows both paths are irreversible: empowering grassroots voices risks open upheaval, while covering up sabotage means enabling authority through deception. His position gives him rare technical freedom, but the choice pits public truth against engineered stability.",
  "choice_a": "Unlock and secure open communication platforms for civic assemblies, enabling mass participation and direct challenge to the Council.",
  "belief_a": [
    "New legitimacy must come from open participation, not hidden systems.",
    "Public truth is more vital than system stability.",
    "Enabling collective voices is worth the risk of disruption."
  ],
  "choice_b": "Suppress evidence of sabotage and focus on quiet utility repairs, shielding the Council from blame and prioritizing technical stability.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Stability matters more than transparency during crises.",
    "Public disorder could tip the city into chaos.",
    "Engineering quiet solutions prevents deeper harm, even if truth is bent."
