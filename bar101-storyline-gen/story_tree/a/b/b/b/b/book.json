  "content": "In 2025, Stenograd, once ruled by the silent logic of the Behavioral Compliance Index, is thrown into turmoil after system engineer Marek Halden\u2019s mysterious death leaves the governance network faltering. As BCI scores begin to fluctuate wildly, unrest brews; frustrations peak when Daria Tomenko, defying the broken order, secretly disables all score displays on health wearables, erasing privilege lines overnight. Residents wake to a city where gates and services are suddenly score-blind, with workers and teachers embracing equal access for all. Oksana Lintz, sensing a tide of change, lends careful support while the resistant Directorate responds with impotent threats and scattered crackdowns, only fueling the city\u2019s quiet revolution. Neighborhoods united in defiance draw growing crowds, their peaceful rallies spreading across Stenograd, as the movement for score-blind equality transforms from a desperate act into the city\u2019s new heartbeat."
