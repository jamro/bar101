  "title": "The Algorithm's Testimony",
  "story_summary": "In the heart of Stenograd, a city run not by politicians but by the silent algorithms of the Behavioral Compliance Index, the sudden death of its architect, Marek Halden, sends ripples through its seamless order. As governance falters and Council factions clash behind closed doors, Oksana Lintz seizes a pivotal moment - she activates the system's witness protocol, unleashing a cascade of Halden's voice disclosing hidden truths. Shaken residents gather as the BCI contradicts the Council's official story, exposing past abuses and sparking citywide debate over where responsibility lies. Sensing a shift, rebel leaders - the ghost assembly - demand transparency and a public vote on algorithmic rule, their momentum swelling as disgraced officials scramble to silence the system. But a failed blackout only fuels outrage, and for the first time in years, the city's people face the question of who truly governs - humans or the algorithms they once trusted.",
