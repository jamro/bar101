  "content": "In 2025, Stenograd\u2019s rigid order collapses after its architect, Marek Halden, is found dead and the city\u2019s all-powerful Behavioral Compliance Index falters. Frustrated by chaotic glitches and unfair reversals in BCI scores, residents\u2014led by quiet dissidents like Daria Tomenko\u2014disable the system\u2019s grip, wiping away privilege-based barriers overnight. Confusion quickly transforms into hope as service workers, teachers, and transit operators refuse to check scores, treating everyone equally and igniting a citywide push for \u201cscore-blind\u201d policies. Bolstered by Oksana Lintz\u2019s cautious support, the movement grows despite Directorate crackdowns. Hidden \u201cghost\u201d citizens return, and open assemblies demand a new civic future. When a shadow ledger exposes the Directorate\u2019s abuses and blackmail, public outrage boils over. Massive protests and tribunals force corrupt leaders out, as Stenograd\u2019s people abandon the BCI and seize the chance to rebuild trust and governance from the ground up."
