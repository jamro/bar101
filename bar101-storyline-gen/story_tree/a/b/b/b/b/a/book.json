  "content": "In 2025, the tightly controlled city of Stenograd is ruled by the silent authority of the Behavioral Compliance Index (BCI), where every resident\u2019s life is shaped by their algorithmic score\u2014until mysterious system failures send scores and privileges into chaos. Frustrated by the BCI\u2019s unpredictable reversals, Daria Tomenko secretly disables the city\u2019s score system, plunging everyone into sudden egalitarian confusion as gates and services ignore status overnight. Emboldened, service workers and teachers embrace \u2018score-blind\u2019 policies, treating all citizens equally and sparking a citywide movement. Oksana Lintz hesitantly supports these reforms, even as security officials threaten crackdowns met with peaceful defiance. The unrest grows, restored \u2018ghost\u2019 citizens and organizers call secret assemblies, and open elections openly challenge the Council\u2019s rule. As mass protests demand a new social contract, the Council\u2014cornered by the groundswell\u2014finally agrees to televised negotiations, signaling a dramatic turning point for Stenograd\u2019s future."
