Delays, confusion, nobody trusts what they\u2019re told. Honestly, feels like I\u2019m patching up a sinking ship lately."

Directorate wanted things quiet, so I locked down evidence and shut out the civic folks. Lost some clients that way\u2014didn\u2019t sit right, but I figured keeping order mattered more. Word\u2019s out now things might\u2019ve been sabotaged. That decision\u2026 well, I can\u2019t say it\u2019s done me any favors. Score tanked overnight, and now folks look at me like I\u2019m the darkness in the wiring. It\u2019s taken a toll. Never wanted to be the bad guy."

Directorate loyalists\u2014my side\u2014quietly pushed me to cover up sabotage. I cut organizers out, erased the signs, told myself stability was worth lying for. Now the city\u2019s snapped back harder than expected. Activists and locals see right through me\u2014clients gone, friends wary. My BCI dropped to rock bottom, which makes me more of a target than a troubleshooter. All that trust I banked over years just vanished. Funny thing, I thought I was protecting order. Turns out I was just taking the blame for someone else\u2019s war. Feels cold, Alex. Real cold."
