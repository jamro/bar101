  "trigger_event": "After late-night conversations with Alex, Rada receives two explosive leaks: the secret ledger of erased 'ghosts' and a declaration from local councils demanding open, score-blind elections. She realizes whichever story she makes public first will dominate the city's next steps.",
  "dilemma": "Rada must choose whether to publish the secret ledger, forcing Stenograd to reckon with its darkest abuses, or spotlight the call for open elections, igniting hope and collective action for a new civic order. Both cannot take center stage at once, and her choice will determine which path the city follows.",
  "reason": "Rada feels torn: exposing past horrors could tear old wounds open but burying them could doom the city to repeat its mistakes. Choosing one means sidelining the other, placing the weight of the city's future on her decision. Her conversations with Alex have reminded her of the human cost\u2014and opportunity\u2014behind each path.",

    "People need hope and agency more than more trauma.",
    "Empowering everyone to participate is the fastest route to healing and rebuilding."
