  "outcome": "Stenograd\u2019s residents, reeling from inexplicable reversals in their BCI status, begin to reject BCI-based privileges entirely. Service workers, teachers, and transit operators enact 'score-blind' policies, treating all citizens equally regardless of BCI status. Oksana Lintz offers cautious support, turning public opinion toward reform. The Directorate responds with threats and scattered crackdowns, but the movement spreads. The BCI\u2019s role as silent enforcer is openly challenged for the first time, shifting the city\u2019s center of authority to everyday acts of defiance.",
