  "dilemma": "Rada must decide whether to use her press credentials to broadcast Halden's confessional message citywide\u2014risking mass unrest and exposing the BCI\u2019s darkest secrets to all\u2014or to secretly pass the materials to a trusted reformist insider, containing the fallout but letting the system handle sensitive revelations quietly.",
  "reason": "The stakes could not be higher: a public broadcast would shatter trust in the system and trigger protests that could spiral out of control, while suppressing the message might protect people from chaos but also enable the Council to bury the truth forever. Rada\u2019s connection with both rebels and cautious insiders\u2014and her probing exchange with Alex\u2014leave her torn between lighting a spark or keeping the peace.",
