  "outcome": "A mysterious citywide broadcast, featuring Halden\u2019s recorded voice, is released. The message stirs public memory and reveals the origins and ethical failures of BCI. Citizens stage collective acts of defiance: open profile swapping, memorial gatherings, and distributed protests. Ghosts use broadcast clues to unlock hidden BCI functions, exposing old erasure records and system manipulation by Council factions. Directorate attempts to suppress unrest with targeted restrictions, but cracks in BCI routines allow mass noncompliance, forcing the Council toward a reckoning and possible systemic reform.",
