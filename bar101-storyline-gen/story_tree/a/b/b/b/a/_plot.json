  "title": "The Ghost Accord",
  "outcome": "The reappeared 'ghosts' organize, leveraging their digital invisibility and access to negotiate with Oksana Lintz. In exchange for public testimony about forced erasures and assistance in stabilizing city infrastructure, Lintz offers limited legal protections and a say in future system reforms. The deal destabilizes established Council factions. As details leak, citizens are divided: some see the ghosts as heroes, others as opportunists. The Directorate quietly prepares measures to monitor the ghosts despite their protected status, deepening the split among leadership.",
