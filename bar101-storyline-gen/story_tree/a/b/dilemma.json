  "dilemma": "Oksana must choose whether to recommend a total shutdown of the BCI and all automated infrastructure, effectively plunging the city into a blackout for a manual reset, or to activate a hidden recovery protocol that could cause erased residents to reappear as untracked 'ghosts', risking widespread panic and exposing deep flaws in the system.",
  "reason": "Oksana is torn: the shutdown could restore order but would spark chaos and expose her to professional and personal risk; activating the ghost patch might reveal the truth behind the BCI\u2019s failures but threatens uncontrollable social consequences and scrutiny. Her low BCI score and recent conversations with Alex, whose outside perspective challenges her certainties, intensify her doubts.",
