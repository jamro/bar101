  "trigger_event": "While responding to urgent device malfunctions in a restored district, Daria discovers a hidden loyalty protocol embedded deep in the BCI firmware, capable of either cementing restored citizens' synchronized loyalty or offering a secret channel for erased 'ghost' identities to slip through the system's watch.",
  "dilemma": "Daria must choose whether to strengthen the system's grip by activating the loyalty protocol, locking restored citizens into total compliance \u2014 or secretly rewire the patch to help erased 'ghosts' bypass security and resist the system. Each decision changes who holds power in Stenograd.",
  "reason": "Daria is torn because her decision will directly determine whether Stenograd moves toward enforced order and public loyalty or unpredictable resistance and chaos. Her technical skills give her this rare influence, but a wrong move could cost her everything \u2014 especially while she\u2019s unsure who to trust or what\u2019s real.",
  "choice_a": "Deploy the official update and activate the loyalty protocol, ensuring restored citizens remain perfectly synchronized and under full system influence.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Unity and stability outweigh the risks of dissent.",
    "Without order, Stenograd could collapse entirely.",
    "Personal agency must sometimes be sacrificed for the greater good."

  "choice_b": "Quietly rewrite the update to introduce a hidden channel that lets erased 'ghost' citizens mask their presence, giving them a fighting chance against total system control.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Resistance and diversity are essential to real progress.",
    "Blanket conformity destroys hope and uniqueness.",
    "It\u2019s worth risking turmoil to offer a lifeline to the erased."
