Fearing chaos, she quietly rallied trusted organizers, helping neighborhoods assume control when BCI privileges collapsed. Marginalized voices banded together, forming the Peoples\u2019 Congress and seizing administration from the faltering Council, but as newfound power corrupted some leaders, frustration grew. Then, urged by Sven Halek\u2019s secret calls for transparency and unity, residents wove a mesh network that bypassed all former authorities. With Oksana\u2019s support, local truth commissions exposed old injustices, empowering citizens to declare independence from both Congress and Council. As the city broke free from centralized rule, the people forged their own resilient, decentralized future\u2014celebrating the hard-won freedom that arose from crisis, betrayal, and the vision of those who dared to reimagine governance."
