  "title": "Ghost List Exposed",
  "story_summary": "In the tightly controlled city of Stenograd, where the old Behavioral Compliance Index once shaped every life, a new scandal erupts. Sven Halek, desperate to keep order, hides evidence that the ruling Congress has secretly revived exclusion lists to control who can access vital resources, echoing the city's troubled past. While Congress leaders publicly promise reform and peace seems to return, whispers of ongoing abuses persist. Everything changes when tenacious journalist Oksana Lintz exposes proof of these so-called 'ghost lists,' igniting public outrage and drawing furious crowds to Congress's doors. As protests swell and emergency hearings unfold, Congress leaders finally admit their wrongdoing and pledge sweeping changes, sparking a fierce citywide debate about breaking free from cycles of surveillance and exclusion once and for all.",
