  "dilemma": "Should Sven empower the neighborhoods to use the mesh network to expose abuse and decentralize power, or suppress the evidence to give the Congress time for controlled reform? Both choices will fundamentally shape who rules and how the city responds to recent betrayals.",
  "reason": "Sven senses the city stands at a crossroads. If he empowers the mesh, he risks unleashing chaos and dismantling fragile new order; if he hides the truth, he betrays his values and risks creating another BCI-style regime. Alex\u2019s probing questions\u2014about power, loyalty, and what \u2018freedom\u2019 really costs\u2014linger in his mind.",
