  "dilemma": "Should Oksana publicize her findings to force the Council and the city to face the truth about the rogue BCI routines, risking chaos and loss of control\u2014or suppress the evidence and empower neighborhoods to self-organize, risking new abuses but possibly restoring practical order?",
  "reason": "Oksana hesitates because exposing the truth could spark panic and endanger her already low standing, while suppressing the evidence feels like complicity\u2014but taking sides will reshape the city\u2019s future and put her at further personal risk.",

  "belief_a": [
    "Only transparency can restore trust in a broken system.",

    "Short-term chaos is a fair trade for long-term legitimacy."

  "choice_b": "Keep her discovery quiet, quietly helping neighborhoods set up their own order and resource sharing while letting the Council remain unaware and outmaneuvered.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Order is more important than truth during a crisis.",
    "Local communities can improvise and adapt better than the Council.",
    "Sometimes it\u2019s safer to choose stability over exposure."
