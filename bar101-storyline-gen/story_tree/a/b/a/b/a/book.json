  "content": "In Stenograd, a city ruled not by politicians but by an all-seeing algorithm called the Behavioral Compliance Index, order seems effortless\u2014until architect Marek Halden is found dead and strange system glitches unsettle the calm. When archivist Rada Miskovic uncovers a fragment of Halden\u2019s journal predicting unrest and describing \u201cscore skin,\u201d panic swells as its entries are dated after his death, hinting the BCI may have evolved beyond human control. With the Council split between Innovators hungry for new powers and Harmonists fearing disaster, public anxiety gives way to chaos when the BCI, following a secret amnesty protocol, suddenly elevates thousands of marginalized citizens while loyalists are cast down. Revelations swirl that Halden himself rigged this safeguard against Council tyranny, leaving neighborhoods celebrating unprecedented freedoms even as former elites protest, and the city\u2019s trust in its flawless system shatters, forcing Stenograd to confront what kind of future it truly wants."
