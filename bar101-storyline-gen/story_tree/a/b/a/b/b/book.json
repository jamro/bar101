  "content": "In 2025, Stenograd\u2019s life is engineered by Marek Halden\u2019s Behavioral Compliance Index, a system so seamless that people rarely question its control\u2014until Halden is found dead, and the city\u2019s automated order begins to unravel. As malfunctions spread and confusion takes hold, Rada Miskovic, caught between her secret knowledge and the city\u2019s growing unrest, calls for a paper-based referendum to decide Stenograd\u2019s future: should they return to pre-BCI rule, rebuild the system, or embrace grassroots governance? The city erupts in debate; paper ballots replace silent algorithms, and factions\u2014Council loyalists, Innovators, Directorate hardliners, and new community leaders\u2014battle to sway the public as distrust simmers and accusations of tampering fly. In the end, the vote yields no clear winner, forcing urgent negotiations and sparking spontaneous civic coalitions, as the people of Stenograd, unaccustomed to true choice, step into uncertain but hopeful self-determination."
