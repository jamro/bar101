  "trigger_event": "A cache of vital, contradictory documents and digital artifacts is uncovered, and Daria finds herself the only one with both the skills and trusted access to release them citywide. One is Halden\u2019s unpublished Spiral Manifesto, a visionary essay on building society around cycles of mutual growth and rotating leadership; the other is the technical protocol for a citywide forgiveness reset that would erase all BCI scores and histories.",
  "dilemma": "Daria must choose: verify and make public Halden's optimistic Spiral Manifesto, hoping to spark cultural renewal and long-term, growth-focused reform\u2014or confirm and release the BCI forgiveness protocol, forcing immediate citywide amnesty and erasure of past divisions, risking chaos but offering a clean slate. She can only pick one, and her decision will irreversibly send Stenograd down one path or the other.",
  "reason": "Daria is unsure because both choices will reshape Stenograd\u2019s future and risk unintended consequences. Picking the manifesto might inspire hope but seems slow and uncertain; activating the protocol would deliver instant change, but the outcome is volatile and possibly destabilizing. Her quiet, systems-minded approach clashes with the emotional stakes\u2014for once, the technician cannot remain a neutral bystander. Conversations with Alex the bartender have challenged her to weigh both what is possible and what is right.",

    "Social resets require decisive action, not more waiting or debate.",
