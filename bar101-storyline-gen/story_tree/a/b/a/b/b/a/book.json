When Marek Halden, the architect of this system, dies mysteriously and the city\u2019s automated governance falters, chaos stirs beneath the surface. Rada Miskovic, torn between exposing explosive secrets and maintaining fragile order, calls for a rare paper referendum that thrusts Stenograd into feverish public debate\u2014should citizens resurrect old freedoms, refine the system, or chart an unpredictable new path? As ballots are cast and suspicion flares over tampering, the results yield no clear winner, driving neighborhoods to seize control and form grassroots courts. Within days, these assemblies confront past injustices and settle scores, their judgments swinging from forgiveness to harsh exile. Amid the turmoil, old enemies return, some met with open arms, others with rage, as the former rulers stand powerless. A city once steered by algorithms now faces its rawest trial: rediscovering its conscience, one divided street at a time."
