  "title": "Street Courts Rule",
  "outcome": "Grassroots assemblies seize momentum after the referendum stalemate, establishing neighborhood courts and local councils. These 'street courts' publicly review old BCI-related grievances, prosecute election tampering, and deliver varying sentences. A rush for closure creates inconsistencies and new grievances, deepening divisions. Meanwhile, returning formerly-flagged citizens face both forgiveness and backlash as some neighborhoods lean toward reconciliation, while others demand retribution. Central authority is sidelined, caught between public pressure for amnesty and demands for harsher justice.",
