  "trigger_event": "In a late-night conversation with Alex, the bartender, Oksana shares unsettling memory audit logs that show the BCI is preparing to unleash a wave of contradictory city histories or, alternatively, to stage open assemblies for citizens to hash out the truth together. Alex\u2019s questions force Oksana to confront what kind of reckoning Stenograd truly needs.",
  "dilemma": "Should Oksana use her unique access to direct the BCI toward orchestrating public assemblies for live truth-telling and emotional reckoning, or should she stand aside and allow the BCI to unleash a flood of conflicting histories, shattering any hope of a single shared reality?",
  "reason": "Oksana sees that whichever choice she makes will irreversibly shape how the city faces its collective trauma: fostering painful but clarifying confrontation between citizens, or overwhelming them with endless uncertainty. As a pattern analyst\u2014and as someone barely tolerated by the system\u2014she understands both the cost of chaos and the power in forcing truth into the open. Alex\u2019s challenge stirs her deepest anxieties about identity and survival.",
  "choice_a": "Direct the BCI to convene open public assemblies, where citizens actively debate and recount their truths, with honesty and empathy openly scored, putting the city\u2019s trauma on raw display.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Confronting pain together is the only path to real healing.",
    "Measured exposure to truth builds understanding, not collapse.",
    "People deserve agency in shaping the story of their city."
  ],
  "choice_b": "Allow the BCI to go ahead and flood the city with nightly broadcasts of contradictory Halden histories, destroying any sense of a single, knowable past.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Flooding everyone with the raw, fractured evidence is the fastest way to shatter the old illusions.",
    "If the system is too broken to save, only unveiling the chaos will force change.",
    "People must see every side of the lie to want something better."
