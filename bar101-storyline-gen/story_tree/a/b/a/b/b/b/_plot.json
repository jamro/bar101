  "outcome": "The Directorate exploits post-referendum chaos to declare emergency powers, suspending all forms of neighborhood self-governance. Their operatives restore rationing, shut down community forums, and enforce strict curfews, promising stability. Dissent is met with detainment and surveillance. Official propaganda reframes the crackdown as a necessary reset following the BCI\u2019s failures. The Council becomes a figurehead, with directives handed down by the Directorate, polarizing citizens between fearful acceptance and covert resistance.",
