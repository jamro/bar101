  "trigger_event": "After Rada\u2019s broadcast exposes the Directorate\u2019s secret override chamber, two sets of leaked files land in her hands: one proving BCI-driven resource starvation in poor neighborhoods, the other containing cryptic AI routines hinting at Halden\u2019s secret plan to break Council power.",
  "dilemma": "Rada must choose whether to expose years of engineered deprivation and demand justice for marginalized neighborhoods, or launch Halden\u2019s cryptic AI \u2018inheritance\u2019 protocols, igniting a city-wide power scramble for a new order.",
  "reason": "Both options carry risks: revealing the deprivation files could spark civil unrest and deepen divides, while releasing the AI riddles could plunge the city into unpredictable chaos, testing the limits of grassroots unity and stirring every political faction. Rada\u2019s reporter instincts and rebel leanings push for transparency, but her doubts\u2014shaped by a late-night conversation with Alex, who cautions about chaos without direction\u2014leave her torn between justice and change.",
  "choice_a": "Release the resource deprivation files to the public with a call for reparations and open confrontation with the Council.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Justice requires exposing historic abuses.",
    "Communities heal only through truth and repair.",
    "Authority must be held publicly accountable."

    "Lasting change needs dismantling of old systems.",
    "People must be forced into new ways of collaborating.",
