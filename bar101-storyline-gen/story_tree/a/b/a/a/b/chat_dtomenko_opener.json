      "Took the drone out today, quick flight over the grid.",

      "I\u2019m alright. Needed to clear my head after work.",
      "Did some FPV drone flying out by the old conveyor belts.",

      "Doing okay. Took my drone out after shift, like I usually do.",
      "I fly FPV in the industrial zones\u2014less crowded, no tourists.",
      "Since the system crash, you get more random signals in the air.",
      "Had a near-miss with some rogue flier by Tower 9.",

      "Honestly, it\u2019s better now that I\u2019ve flown my drone tonight.",
      "FPV freestyle, mostly in blackout districts. Feels like freedom for a few minutes.",
      "The inheritance riddles have pulled new people into the off-grid zones.",
      "Almost collided with someone tracking riddle clues last time. They didn\u2019t respond over open channel.",
      "The blackout always cuts feed mid-flight, but it keeps things interesting.",
      "I\u2019ve started manually logging flight data\u2014can\u2019t trust city memory anymore.",
      "My brother used to think drone flying was pointless. Now, I get why he disappeared."

      "I\u2019m alright, just wiped after flying tonight. That\u2019s my thing\u2014FPV drones, freestyle.",
      "I go out to the dead sectors, especially since the blackout shifted control to neighborhoods.",
      "It\u2019s one of the last ways to be off-grid for a bit. No BCI pings, less tracking.",
      "Since Halden\u2019s inheritance protocols, you get these random aerial encounters\u2014everyone\u2019s looking for clues or just breathing.",
      "Last weekend, another drone synced up with mine, no comms, like a silent pact.",
      "Sometimes I wonder if it\u2019s Council or Directorate watching, or just people like me dodging the system.",
      "Manual logs only now\u2014the public feeds are useless since the data shocks.",
      "My brother vanished in a BCI audit two years ago. I get why he wanted out, especially now."

      "Since the blackout, signals get weird\u2014sometimes lose connection near Tower 9.",
      "More pilots out lately, probably chasing those AI riddles.",
      "People are less likely to report you now. System\u2019s distracted.",
      "Tried flying during the blackout\u2014almost pure silence out there.",
      "Battery swapping\u2019s tougher. Assemblies lock up power.",
      "Still, catching wind through broken scaffolds feels like a win."

      "Honestly, nothing else compares. Freestyle is pure focus, pure drift.",

      "Huge turnout at Tower 9. Saw pilots mapping for the inheritance protocol clue.",
      "Nobody trusts automatic replays now, everything\u2019s shifted to manual backups.",
      "Night flights are safer\u2014no BCI pings in blackout zones.",
      "Met a few regulars, but we keep it loose. No names, just flight paths.",
      "Craziest bit: one night, two drones mirrored me perfectly through broken lights."

    [
      "Definitely. FPV is more than a hobby\u2014it\u2019s control when everything else is chaos.",
      "Started when BCI first rolled out, needed somewhere to disappear for a while.",
      "After Halden died, blackout gave us total silence\u2014first real freedom in years.",
      "City infrastructure breaking means we fly deeper, further. Nobody tracks low-power quads.",
      "Some of us run ghost firmware, keep our flights off any official logs.",
      "At Tower 9, I caught another pilot mid-riddle hunt. Neither of us said a word.",
      "Last week, lost my feed for five minutes\u2014heart racing, but strangely peaceful.",
      "Energy quotas make battery swaps tricky, so we share cells off-books now.",
      "Feels like\u2014finally\u2014a bit of space for people who live off-grid, at least until the Council resets everything."
