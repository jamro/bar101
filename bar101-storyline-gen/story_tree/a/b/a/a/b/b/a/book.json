Amid the confusion, Rada\u2014a determined reformer\u2014emerged, calling for public truth-telling to heal old wounds. She ordered lockdowns in districts shadowed by past abuses, offering the restoration of vital services as a reward for confessions. Tensions soared as public forums drew out painful admissions, pitting honest reckonings against stubborn silence.

Now, with shaken faith in their overseers, the citizens\u2014and the Council itself\u2014stood at a crossroads, debating whether forgiveness or authority would shape Stenograd\u2019s future."
