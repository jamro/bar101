  "trigger_event": "While working alone in a forgotten control vault during the BCI lockdown, Lenart discovers Halden's root override: two dormant protocols\u2014one to reset BCI scores based on confessions, and another to hand over district control to neighborhood assemblies. With mounting city unrest and a drink-fueled conversation echoing in his mind, he realizes he must choose which key to turn.",
  "dilemma": "Should Lenart reactivate the BCI to reward confession and punish concealment, trying to restore trust through official forgiveness\u2014or should he unlock the assembly-run spiral system, letting communities manage resources and access independently from central control?",
  "reason": "Lenart is torn: turning the key for forgiveness risks making him complicit in a system many distrust, while empowering neighborhood assemblies might unleash chaos, but could also finally break old chains. Alex\u2019s words about second chances and self-reliance haunt him as he weighs the consequences.",
  "choice_a": "Reactivate the BCI forgiveness protocol, instantly recalibrating scores for those who confessed and punishing those who hid their actions.",
  "belief_a": [
    "True reconciliation needs visible signs from the system itself.",
    "People deserve a public path to redemption, not permanent suspicion.",
    "Only a clear act from above can calm the city\u2019s rising anger."
  ],
  "choice_b": "Unleash the spiral override, handing access to local assemblies so they can run services and movement by self-issued permits, bypassing BCI control.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Lasting change starts from the ground up, not from above.",
    "People must try making their own rules if trust is ever to return.",
    "Only shared risk teaches real responsibility."
