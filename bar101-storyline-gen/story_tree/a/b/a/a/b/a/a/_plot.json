  "outcome": "Neighborhood assemblies organize a public Truth Tribunal where Council, Directorate, and grassroots leaders\u2014especially Rada\u2014must answer for years of BCI abuse. Halden\u2019s own archived thoughts and doubts, newly uncovered, are aired. Empathy layers Halden hid in the system are revealed, showing Halden attempted restraint, while others pushed for harsher control. Collective confessions, citywide dialogue, and direct confrontation finally clarify Halden\u2019s intentions and the causes of his death.",
