Surrounded by swirling rumors and counsel from Alex, she is pressed to make a defining decision as the city\u2019s mood teeters between catharsis and chaos.",
  "dilemma": "Should Rada call for a powerful, citywide Truth Tribunal to force public confessions and open dialogue, risking slow reform\u2014or secretly unleash Halden's 'Final Inheritance Protocol,' giving random citizens the reins of city power, embracing total uncertainty and potential upheaval?",
  "reason": "Rada is torn between her lifelong dedication to revealing truth and her deep mistrust of official processes. She fears a Tribunal could drown in spectacle, yet worries that giving away system control could spark chaos or revenge. Alex\u2019s probing questions challenge her to choose not just what Stenograd deserves, but what it can survive.",
  "choice_a": "Galvanize the city to participate in a public Truth Tribunal, demanding confessions and restorative dialogue from all factions under the eyes of citizens and AI-released Halden archives.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Collective reckoning is the only path to healing state violence.",
    "Even flawed institutions can be harnessed for public good if transparency is absolute.",

  "choice_b": "Unleash Halden\u2019s Final Inheritance Protocol, giving ordinary citizens temporary control of BCI subsystems and city infrastructure, igniting unpredictable reforms and risks.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Real change only comes when power leaves the hands of old authorities.",
    "Bottom-up action, though unstable, carries the promise of genuine freedom.",
    "Widespread risk is better than repeating cycles of hidden abuse."
