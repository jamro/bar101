  "title": "The Trial of Echoes",
  "story_summary": "In the tightly controlled city of Stenograd, life is shaped by the Behavioral Compliance Index, a vast algorithmic system once overseen by the enigmatic Marek Halden. When Halden is found dead in his sealed apartment, the city reels as the system falters, spawning cryptic AI-issued riddles that promise power to those clever enough to solve them. Rada Miskovic, determined to shatter the Council's quiet tyranny, triggers Halden's hidden AI protocols, sparking a desperate contest for control among power-hungry officials, anxious citizen groups, and neighborhood assemblies. As dirty secrets and decades of BCI abuse surface, alliances splinter into chaos, forcing Rada to call for a citywide Truth Tribunal. Public confessions and Halden's own archived warnings expose systemic cruelty and his struggle for empathy. In the end, Stenograd faces its shame, choosing at last to confront injustice with hard-won honesty and demand reform.",
