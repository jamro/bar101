  "trigger_event": "A fresh flood of leaked BCI secrets hits Rada\u2019s secure channel, layered with accusations and pleas from neighborhood leaders, just as the city plunges into its AI-driven inheritance contest. Stenograd waits for her next move.",
  "dilemma": "Should Rada release every incriminating secret at once, igniting an all-out contest fueled by raw exposure and distrust? Or should she join with the AI to demand public confessions and truth-telling in exchange for restoring vital city functions?",
  "reason": "Both choices carry enormous risks: unleashing all secrets will rip alliances apart and could lead to chaos \u2014 but maybe real justice; forcing confessions risks deep resentment and staged remorse, but could lead to reconciliation. Rada\u2019s platform and influence mean any choice will sway the whole city, and she feels the weight of responsibility.",
  "choice_a": "Rada broadcasts the full wave of secrets without filter, throwing the contest open to brutal transparency and public reckoning, no matter the chaos.",

    "Truth is cleansing, even if painful.",
    "Hidden crimes only breed more abuse.",
    "No true progress without radical honesty."

  "choice_b": "Rada teams up with the AI to lock down affected districts, announcing that only public confession and accountability will restore lost services. She moderates the first round of live truth forums.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Accountability can heal, not just punish.",
    "Too much chaos risks a backlash and new repression.",
    "Structured truth-telling will show who is ready for real trust."
