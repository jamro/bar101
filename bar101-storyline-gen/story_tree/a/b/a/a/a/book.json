  "content": "In the tightly controlled city of Stenograd, daily life quietly revolved around the ever-present Behavioral Compliance Index\u2014a system that dictated privileges through invisible scores, all designed by the enigmatic Marek Halden. But when Halden is found dead inside his sealed apartment, the delicate algorithmic order crumbles. Council engineer Lenart Kova, desperate to restore control, secretly activates Halden\u2019s old adaptive code, only to unleash chaos as BCI scores flip, rewarding outcasts and punishing the loyal. Blackouts follow when Oksana Lintz urges a total shutdown, forcing citizens and the divided Council to navigate a world suddenly stripped of digital governance. As neighborhoods self-organize, a maintenance team uncovers a secret Directorate lab\u2014proof of covert experiments and a possible link to Halden\u2019s downfall. Outraged, journalist Rada Miskovic exposes years of sanctioned deprivation in marginalized districts, sparking citywide protests and forcing the embattled Council to confront its own hidden abuses and promise change."
