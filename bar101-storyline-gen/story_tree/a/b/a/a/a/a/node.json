  "title": "Reckoning Tribunal",
  "story_summary": "In the heart of Stenograd, a city run by the all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index, order is shaped not by politics but by silent algorithms - until the system's architect, Marek Halden, is found dead. As daily life unravels, compliant citizens find themselves inexplicably locked out while former outcasts gain sudden privileges, fueling a black market for fake scores. Lenart Kova, desperate to restore order, gambles on reactivating Halden's legacy code, but chaos only deepens. When a sweeping blackout shuts down BCI-linked systems, the city grinds to a halt, forcing old Council rivals and ordinary residents back into the uncertainty of manual rule. In this darkness, a forgotten Directorate experiment is uncovered - proof of secret overrides and possibly Halden's murder. Grassroots leaders seize the moment, stirring protests and exposing years of hidden resource deprivation. As outrage boils, the Council launches a televised Truth Tribunal, inviting testimonies that lay bare the city's wounds, until sabotage silences the reckoning, leaving Stenograd more divided - and awake - than ever before.",
