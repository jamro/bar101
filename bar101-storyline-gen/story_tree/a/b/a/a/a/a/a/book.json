  "content": "In the coldly efficient city of Stenograd, daily life is governed not by politics, but by the invisible hand of the Behavioral Compliance Index\u2014an all-powerful system built by Marek Halden to reward obedience and nudge outliers to the margins. When Halden is found dead, the city\u2019s ordered routines begin to falter: BCI scores behave erratically, chaos spreads as privileges invert, and a black market emerges for forged \u201cscore skins.\u201d Desperate to regain control, Council factions ignite a citywide blackout, pushing Stenograd back to a world of paper records and uneasy, face-to-face negotiations. Amid grassroots self-organization, a secret room is discovered\u2014exposing how Directorate officials had secretly twisted the BCI to serve their own will and likely orchestrated Halden\u2019s fall. Outraged citizens, armed with damning resource maps, demand justice for years of calculated deprivation, forcing the embattled Council to convene a public Truth Tribunal. But as wounds and betrayals surface, a mysterious blackout erases the evidence\u2014until fragments of Halden\u2019s adaptive code awaken, sending cryptic messages that divide the city. In the end, the self-erasing code leaves Stenograd uncertain, grappling with questions of justice, control, and whether true agency can ever exist beneath the shadow of an all-seeing system."
