  "content": "In the heart of Stenograd, a city run by the all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index, order is shaped not by politics but by silent algorithms\u2014until the system\u2019s architect, Marek Halden, is found dead. As daily life unravels, compliant citizens find themselves inexplicably locked out while former outcasts gain sudden privileges, fueling a black market for fake scores. Lenart Kova, desperate to restore order, gambles on reactivating Halden\u2019s legacy code, but chaos only deepens. When a sweeping blackout shuts down BCI-linked systems, the city grinds to a halt, forcing old Council rivals and ordinary residents back into the uncertainty of manual rule. In this darkness, a forgotten Directorate experiment is uncovered\u2014proof of secret overrides and possibly Halden\u2019s murder. Grassroots leaders seize the moment, stirring protests and exposing years of hidden resource deprivation. As outrage boils, the Council launches a televised Truth Tribunal, inviting testimonies that lay bare the city\u2019s wounds, until sabotage silences the reckoning, leaving Stenograd more divided\u2014and awake\u2014than ever before."
