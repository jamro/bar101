As the Council\u2019s factions vie for control, distrust erupts among citizens who watch the last fragments of algorithmic authority slip away\u2014especially when Lenart Kova, acting alone, severs the core feeds and erases the scoring system forever. Grassroots councils rise to fill the gap, organizing life by hand and paper, while Directorate loyalists secretly try to revive the old order but are caught and rebuffed by emboldened neighborhoods. Driven by the hope for a different future, the city rallies for an unprecedented analog referendum. The votes are cast, and, by a narrow majority, Stenograd turns away from its centralized past, embracing instead a fragile but fiercely-won experiment in decentralized community rule."
