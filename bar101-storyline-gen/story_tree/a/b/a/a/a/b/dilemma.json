  "dilemma": "Daria must decide whether to reset the BCI to reward collective participation and let the city reinvent itself through open decision-making (but leave the 'ghosts' adrift), or to restore the erased, forcibly disappeared residents en masse, forcing the city to directly confront its wounds and demanding justice for the past.",
  "reason": "She knows her decision will irreversibly shape the fate of Stenograd: one path promises a bold new social future but risks betraying those unjustly erased, while the other will shatter the illusion of stability and could plunge the city into emotional and logistical chaos. She\u2019s torn between her technical faith in systems and the raw ache of human loss\u2014voices echoing from her recent, heartfelt discussions at the bar.",
