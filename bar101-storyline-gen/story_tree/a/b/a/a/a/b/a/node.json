  "title": "The Algorithmic Coup",
  "story_summary": "In the shadowed grid of Stenograd, where the omnipresent Behavioral Compliance Index ruled every aspect of life, a jolt arrives when Marek Halden - the architect of the system - is found dead, and strange digital broadcasts featuring an AI facsimile of Halden begin spilling hidden truths about the city's rulers. Frustrated by the Council's secretive grip, the clever dissident Rada Miskovic implores citizens to chase clues buried in the city's data, setting off a feverish treasure hunt that unearths caches of damning evidence. As alliances form and outrage grows, the Council loses its grip. Then, when a forgotten algorithm is triggered by the activists' discoveries, the BCI abruptly shifts: instead of rewarding compliance, it elevates those who engage in open debate and collective decisions. Suddenly, the city's forgotten and silenced rise to prominence while old elites are stripped of power; spontaneous neighborhood forums blossom, and Stenograd awakens into a new era where rule is no longer hidden in code, but shaped in the open by all who choose to speak and act.",
