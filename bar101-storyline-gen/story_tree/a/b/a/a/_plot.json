  "outcome": "Three days after the blackout, a maintenance team uncovers a dormant elevator leading to a secret basement room. Inside: a cracked screen endlessly flashing old BCI overlays and files marked 'Directive Unfinished.' Council analysis links this to unauthorized Directorate experiments conducted during the earliest BCI trials. A forensic sweep reveals the Directorate used this space to run proto-BCI experiments and override city controls, independent of Halden's design. Grassroots networks seize on the news, demanding removal of Directorate members and full exposure of off-record projects. Power struggles ripple through the Council as evidence hints the Directorate may have orchestrated Halden\u2019s demise.",
