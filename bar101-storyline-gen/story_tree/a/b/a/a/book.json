  "content": "In the heart of Stenograd, a city governed by the invisible hand of the Behavioral Compliance Index, order begins to unravel after its architect, Marek Halden, is found dead in his locked home. Without his steady guidance, the BCI\u2019s automated algorithms stray: upright citizens are denied simple privileges while former outcasts move freely, giving rise to a black market for forged identities. Lenart Kova, desperate to restore balance, secretly reboots Halden\u2019s legacy code, only to trigger deeper chaos that erodes trust in the Council. Amid growing confusion, Oksana Lintz urges a full-scale manual shutdown, plunging Stenograd into darkness. Forced to govern by hand, the Council grapples with grassroots uprisings and fierce internal divisions. When maintenance workers uncover a secret Directorate lab tied to covert experiments\u2014and perhaps Halden\u2019s demise\u2014citizens, led by Rada Miskovic, demand the Directorate\u2019s ousting and true transparency. As protests swell, the city stands at the threshold of transformation, the future of its automated order hanging in the balance."
