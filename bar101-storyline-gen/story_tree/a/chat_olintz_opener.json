      "Yeah, still dry. Not much changes. I usually do some, uh, origami at home, keeps my hands busy. Nothing special. Last week I couldn't get paper for a while because of, you know, the service delays."

    [
      "Dry enough. Been a long week. I fold origami sometimes\u2014little shapes. Makes waiting out delays a bit more tolerable. Actually, the tram breakdown jammed up my routine the other day, had to improvise with scraps."

    [
      "Still dry. Hasn't rained in a while, but that's not what slows things down lately. I've got this thing for folding origami\u2014just scrap paper, receipts, whatever I can find. Honestly, after I got stuck on the tram last week during that system outage, I passed the time making a few paper flowers. Even gave one away to a kid\u2014she seemed to like it."
    ],
    [
      "Yeah, dry as ever. But the real delays are inside\u2014everything slows these days. I used to look forward to quiet nights making origami, even after long shifts. Last week, during that big BCI glitch, I ended up teaching myself how to fold a kusudama ball using nothing but receipts from my pockets on the tram. Funny way to cope, I guess, when everything outside your control locks up."

    [
      "Bone dry. And those so-called 'minor disruptions'\u2014feels like we measure days by what the system breaks next, not the weather. You know, I got into origami because folding sharp edges into something simple gave me a sense of order. Last week, stuck on the tram while the BCI froze, I found myself folding every bit of scrap I could scrounge\u2014receipts, a transfer stub. The paper was awful for it, but I managed a little sphere. It's silly, but\u2014when things are unpredictable, I like proving something can still come together. Nobody at work really knows that's how I unwind; it's the only thing that stays purely mine."

      "Yeah, folded a few. Nothing special.",
      "Paper\u2019s easier to get than it used to be\u2014if you know where to look.",
      "Can\u2019t really do much when the city keeps stalling public transit, though.",
      "These glitches lately just mean more waiting, less folding, honestly.",

      "Mhm, a few cranes. Actually, I folded an orb out of tram receipts the other day.",
      "Transit delays meant we were stuck\u2014gave me time to do something with my hands.",
      "The paper\u2019s not ideal, but you can make do, actually\u2014creases show flaws but also character.",
      "Feels like whenever the system\u2019s off-balance, I end up folding more. Kind of coping, I guess.",
      "People glance, but I don\u2019t mind much\u2014sometimes I even leave the models for someone else to find."

    [
      "Yeah, and not just cranes\u2014had time for a whole kusudama flower during the last big delay.",
      "When the BCI glitched, everyone froze up, just waiting. I started folding to stay calm.",
      "It\u2019s strange, but folding paper in those tense moments helps me feel a little\u2026 outside of things, you know?",
      "Sometimes a kid will watch, or someone asks for one\u2014small kindnesses, when everything else is cold and procedural.",
      "Honestly, these system hiccups force you to find small ways to keep your focus. Origami\u2019s mine."

    [
      "Definitely\u2014more than usual, in fact. The city\u2019s so on edge, folding is all I can control.",
      "I was stuck during that BCI-induced tram stoppage for ages\u2014used old receipts to make a modular sphere. The paper was awful, but it kept my mind from spiraling.",
      "People looked restless, but seeing someone quietly folding seemed to soften the standoffishness\u2014even gave a flower to a kid, made her smile.",
      "Funny thing\u2014I started origami years back to occupy myself during slow data patches at work. Now, with everything so automated and unpredictable, it\u2019s turned into survival. A way to create order while everything else is up for review.",
      "Feels like everyone\u2019s routines are getting rewritten by algorithms. At least my folding still belongs to me\u2014creases, mistakes, and all."
