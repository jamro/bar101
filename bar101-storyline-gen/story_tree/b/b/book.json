Fearing chaos as the city\u2019s automated systems falter, security chief Sven Halek persuades the ruling Council to black out all civilian digital communication, plunging everyday life into a tense quiet. Cut off from familiar networks, citizens invent new ways to reach each other\u2014scribbled notes, whispered messages\u2014carrying leaked fragments of Halden\u2019s forbidden debates that question Council control. As distrust grows, people silently flood the boulevards, their united silence a powerful refusal to obey. By the month\u2019s end, the once-invisible system is naked, and the Council\u2019s grip is broken by the simple, relentless ingenuity of a population that refuses to be managed."
