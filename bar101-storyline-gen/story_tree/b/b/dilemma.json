  "trigger_event": "While repairing overloaded utility nodes in the wake of the citywide communications blackout, Lenart Kova comes across two powerful secrets: lists of citizens who disappeared from BCI records, and old system override codes that could hand resource control to local communities.",
  "dilemma": "Should Lenart leak the lists of missing citizens to ignite public outrage and expose the Council\u2019s abuses, or use his privileged access to quietly enable neighborhoods to self-organize and bypass BCI control?",
  "reason": "Both decisions have huge risks. Leaking the lists could force the Council\u2019s hand and provoke a crackdown, but might finally bring justice and truth for the missing. Quietly empowering local groups could bring stability and new hope\u2014but lets the Council\u2019s secrets fester, while possibly causing chaos. Lenart\u2019s recent late-night talks with Alex, the bartender, have made him question whether bold exposure or patient, collective action offers the real way forward.",

    "Real change grows when people organize themselves.",
