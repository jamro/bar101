  "dilemma": "Nikola faces a stark choice: Should he urge the committee to force a single citywide BCI standard\u2014risking stifling local experiments but preserving stability\u2014or unlock Halden\u2019s spiral override for all free zones, embracing local justice even if it breeds unpredictable new divisions?",
  "reason": "Nikola is torn between his lifelong suspicion of centralized power and the real fear of unleashing rival factions on ordinary citizens. His recent late-night conversations with Alex, the bartender, echo in his mind\u2014urging him to weigh human needs over rigid order. Nikola knows his signature alone can tip the balance, with no clear path back once chosen.",
