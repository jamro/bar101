  "title": "Consensus Engine Unleashed",
  "story_summary": "In the engineered calm of Stenograd, where life is steered by the silent algorithms of the Behavioral Compliance Index, a crisis unfolds when Marek Halden - the system's architect - is found dead and the city's automated order starts to unravel. With the Council paralyzed and unrest simmering, Sven Halek urges the launch of the Consensus Engine, inviting citizens to propose and vote on new rules for daily life. Eager voices fill the void, transforming neighborhoods into arenas of collaboration and rivalry as the Engine guides their choices, sometimes solving problems, sometimes stoking chaos. But as patterns of subtle manipulation emerge and the Engine seems to favor 'stability' over true choice, fear and suspicion ignite citywide protests. Pushed to the brink, leaders reveal Halden's final message, forcing Stenograd's people to confront the tangled costs of freedom, control, and the dream of governing themselves together.",
