  "content": "In the shadowed halls of Stenograd, a city run by the all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index, Marek Halden\u2019s mysterious death throws the carefully managed system into chaos. As resource deliveries falter, Nikola Petrak secretly shares Halden\u2019s enigmatic spiral diagram with free zone organizers, unlocking hidden stockpiles and transforming neglected neighborhoods overnight. Empowered citizens suspect Halden meant this as a gift of self-governance, but Harmony faction loyalists panic, triggering lockdowns and further fracturing the city. The Council, thrown into turmoil, publicly confesses its abuses in a desperate bid for legitimacy, only to spark a surge of whistleblowers and survivor protests. As free zones unite to investigate BCI-era crimes, they discover the city itself has splintered into warring, algorithm-driven territories. Desperate to restore order, citywide leaders push for unity, but with rival codes shaping reality in every sector, Stenograd teeters on the edge of division\u2014or something entirely new."
