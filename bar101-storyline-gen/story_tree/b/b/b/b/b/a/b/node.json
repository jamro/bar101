  "title": "Halden's Ghost Directive",
  "story_summary": "In the silent, tightly controlled city of Stenograd, life runs smoothly under the all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index - until Marek Halden, the architect of the system, is found dead, and strange disruptions ripple through daily routines. Without warning, resources arrive in the wrong places, jobs shift suddenly, and citizens whisper that Halden's ghost now guides their lives. Behind the scenes, Rada Miskovic secretly launches a protocol that mimics Halden, blocking the ruling Council's desperate attempts to regain control. As confusion grows and the city buzzes with rumors, the system interrupts everything, asking everyone to choose: submit to the algorithm's order or embrace uncertain community rule. Stenograd freezes, caught between spectral authority and the possibility of reclaiming its own future.",
