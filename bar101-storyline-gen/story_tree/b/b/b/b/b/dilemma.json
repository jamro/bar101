  "trigger_event": "Daria receives dual urgent system requests: one to finalize and deploy the Council's new Loyalty Lottery algorithm for resource allocation, and a second, encrypted directive authorizing her to release confidential audit logs and medical records on Marek Halden's death.",
  "dilemma": "Daria must choose between enabling the Council\u2019s Loyalty Lottery system\u2014knowing it may reinforce inequity\u2014or leaking the truth about Halden\u2019s demise and sparking open public reckoning. Both actions are mutually exclusive and will shape either a stabilizing fa\u00e7ade or confrontational change.",
  "reason": "As a firmware technician trusted with deploying system updates during the crisis, Daria is uniquely positioned to either support order (at personal moral cost) or pursue truth (at risk of igniting citywide unrest). Her conversations with Alex, the bartender, remind her of the very real human stakes behind abstract choices.",
  "choice_a": "Approve and implement the Council\u2019s Loyalty Lottery, prioritizing stability and visible resource fairness, even if it means hiding the flaws.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Temporary order protects the vulnerable better than chaos.",
    "Some progress\u2014however imperfect\u2014can be built upon later.",
    "Owning the system's flaws internally is preferable to feeding public distrust."
  ],
  "choice_b": "Leak Halden\u2019s audit and medical records, exposing Council cover-up and risking public outrage to force honest reckoning.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Truth is the only path to lasting legitimacy.",
    "Transparency empowers people to demand fair systems.",
    "Suppressing facts breeds suspicion and deeper conflict."
