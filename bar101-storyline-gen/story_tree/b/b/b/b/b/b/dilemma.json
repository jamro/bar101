  "trigger_event": "After a night of confiding his doubts to Alex, the bartender, Sven emerges into a city where angry crowds demand public reckoning for Halden\u2019s death and the Council's deceptions. With the city on edge and his authority as Strategic Messaging Advisor, Sven knows he must choose what message goes out over the public grid and BCI\u2014without delay.",
  "dilemma": "Sven must decide whether to publicly broadcast a call for a tribunal against the Council, demanding direct justice and risking chaos, or to unlock Halden's civic simulations, inviting the city to deliberate together on possible futures and potentially defusing the anger through dialogue.",
  "reason": "Both choices will determine the city\u2019s next direction. Sven fears a tribunal could fracture Stenograd, but worries that civic simulations might be seen as sidestepping accountability. The conversation with Alex awakened his personal longing for meaningful change, even as he feels the full weight of shaping the narrative.",
  "choice_a": "Broadcast a citywide call for a tribunal, forcing Council members to face public testimony and launching a direct reckoning with the past.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Justice must be visible to restore public trust.",
    "The powerful must answer to the people, or legitimacy crumbles.",
    "True change starts with a reckoning, not with collective forgetting."
  ],
  "choice_b": "Release Halden\u2019s hidden civic simulations on every public display, transforming the city\u2019s anger into open debate and future-focused forums.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Lasting reform comes from collective imagination, not punishment.",
    "A fractured city needs shared vision more than retribution.",
    "Empowering citizens to choose creates deeper change than exposing the past."
