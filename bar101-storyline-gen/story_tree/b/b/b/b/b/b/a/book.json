  "content": "In the tightly controlled city of Stenograd, where the Behavioral Compliance Index silently shapes every life, the sudden death of Marek Halden\u2014the system\u2019s reclusive architect\u2014sets off a chain of upheaval. Torn between loyalty and conscience, Daria Tomenko risks everything to leak evidence exposing the Council\u2019s role in Halden\u2019s demise and their attempt to bury the truth. Outrage surges as the city\u2019s free zones erupt in vigils and protests, forcing panicked Council leaders into emergency debates and rare, reluctant transparency. But the damage is done: emboldened by public support, citizens call for a tribunal, and driven by mounting testimony\u2014including a Harmonist\u2019s confession of past abuses\u2014they demand a new path. The city votes to dissolve the old Council, handing power to randomly chosen citizen juries, and as Stenograd\u2019s brittle order gives way, the people reclaim the future from the algorithms that once governed their fate."
