On public displays, citizens watch alternate versions of recent years\u2014where Halden lived, or the Directorate seized total control, or the free zones failed. Neighborhoods debate which path to take, using the simulations as a guide for future policy. Street gatherings transform into participatory forums where everyone votes on which vision of Stenograd they want to realize. The process leads to a collective reckoning with Halden's legacy\u2014not as an answer, but as a catalyst for real self-government.",
