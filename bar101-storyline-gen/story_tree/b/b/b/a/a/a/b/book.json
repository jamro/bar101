But even greater tremors follow when Sven Halek, seeking truth over stability, reveals that \u201cHalden\u201d never existed at all, but was a mask for the Council\u2019s secret collusion. News spreads like wildfire, igniting outrage and suspicion; alliances crumble as citizens turn on one another, unsure who to trust. Neighborhoods fracture into tribunals and accusations, demands for true justice running rampant while the dream of collective self-rule unravels.
