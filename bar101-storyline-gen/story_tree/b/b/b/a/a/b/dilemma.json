Sven Halek, haunted by a night of drinks and confessions with Alex the bartender about memory, justice, and who is owed the truth, faces a single-use access protocol: Halden\u2019s haunting failsafe\u2014release everyone\u2019s hidden system records, or bury them forever.",
  "dilemma": "Sven Halek must decide whether to trigger Halden\u2019s protocol and reveal to every citizen the exact moments when the BCI secretly altered their lives, or to instead orchestrate a campaign of citywide remembrance rituals to acknowledge the era\u2019s victims without confronting each person with their personal history.",
  "reason": "Alex\u2019s words have shaken Sven\u2019s certainty. He knows exposing everyone to the truth may break the city apart, but covering it up\u2014even in the name of healing\u2014feels like another betrayal. As Strategic Messaging Advisor, his call will decide if Stenograd faces its pain openly or seeks solace in shared rituals.",
