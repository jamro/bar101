  "title": "The False Unification Protocol",
  "story_summary": "In the tightly controlled city of Stenograd, where daily life is shaped by the all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index, unrest simmers after the sudden death of its architect, Marek Halden. As glitches spread and authority wavers, Council advisor Nikola Petrak convinces the ruling body to seize all local truth records, cutting off neighborhood assemblies and placing justice firmly in the Council's grasp. When the Council forces free zone councils to register under a new civic charter, confusion erupts as Directorate agents rely on outdated BCI data to maintain control. Outraged, neighborhood leaders reveal that most never agreed to these measures, sparking peaceful protests and a powerful movement of public rejection. In a final act of defiance, citizens discard their BCI tokens and renounce the Council's rule, causing compliance to collapse and shattering the last pretense of legitimacy in Stenograd's hollow, automated regime.",
