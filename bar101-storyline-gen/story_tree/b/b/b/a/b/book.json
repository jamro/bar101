Rather than exposing Halden\u2019s secret intervention logs, she secretly allies with free zone engineers to awaken the long-dormant 'Reconciliation Spiral' protocol, giving previously flagged citizens a genuine chance to rejoin society. As this quiet revolution takes root, hope and heated debates ripple through the city\u2014some embrace stories of redemption, even electing reintegrated individuals as local leaders, while the security-obsessed Directorate denounces the protocol as a grave threat. Tensions mount as open forums split the population between forgiveness and fear, each side fiercely defending its vision of justice and safety, and Stenograd stands on the brink, uncertain whether compassion or control will shape its future."
