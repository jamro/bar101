  "dilemma": "Should Oksana authorize the decryption and public release of the 'Forgiveness Ledger,' confronting the city with raw truths and personal histories, or withhold it in favor of nurturing a youth-led, forward-looking process for citywide healing?",
  "reason": "Oksana hesitates because exposing the ledger could bring fresh pain and angry division, but suppressing it might feel like hiding the truth and undermining trust. Her access and data authority make the choice hers alone, and echoes of recent confessions with Alex press on her conscience.",
  "choice_a": "Approve the release of the 'Forgiveness Ledger,' letting the city confront every personal act of mercy or complicity during the BCI period.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Honest reconciliation must face the real actions of individuals, not just abstract systems.",
    "Mercy is only meaningful if it is seen and judged openly, including its consequences.",
    "Only by airing uncomfortable truths can trust be rebuilt for the future."
  ],
  "choice_b": "Withhold the 'Forgiveness Ledger,' archiving it and instead channeling resources to help youth organize new forums and imagine a future-oriented justice.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Sometimes, moving forward requires releasing the past instead of reliving every wound.",
    "Real healing may best come from empowering a new generation\u2019s vision, not old power structures.",
    "It is better to unite around new principles than fragment over old secrets."
