When Halden was found dead in his locked apartment and the system began to falter, fear gripped the city\u2019s rulers. The powerful Directorate pushed propaganda, urging calm and hiding the system\u2019s failures, while Nikola Petrak publicly called for unity and released carefully chosen stories. But the citizens saw through these efforts, flooding the streets with silent protests and reading Halden\u2019s final warnings in city squares, letting tales of past abuses ripple through the crowds. As peaceful demonstrations swelled, pressure mounted until the Council and Directorate stepped down, dissolving the old order and allowing citizens\u2019 assemblies to guide Stenograd into a new, self-governed era."
