  "content": "In the silent, model-driven city of Stenograd, the sudden death of BCI architect Marek Halden shakes a fragile order, sending tremors through its unseen algorithms. Daria Tomenko, choosing quiet resistance, secretly joins free zone engineers to awaken the long-dormant Reconciliation Spiral: a protocol giving flagged, once-shunned citizens pathways back into the system. Early successes bring cautious hope, but soon ignite fierce debate\u2014between those craving forgiveness and Directorate hardliners demanding control. As stories of renewal spread and the protocol gains momentum, shadowy Directorate loyalists retaliate, sabotaging the system and sowing fear. Sensing growing chaos, Oksana Lintz releases suppressed BCI records, exposing the regime\u2019s darkest injustices and fueling outrage. United by revelation and betrayal, free zones cast off Council authority, reclaim their systems, and vow never again to let blind algorithms rule over their humanity."
