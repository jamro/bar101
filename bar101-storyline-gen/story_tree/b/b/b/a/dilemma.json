  "trigger_event": "During a routine emergency audit after widespread BCI failures, Daria discovers two hidden files: one a set of audio logs revealing years of secret BCI interventions in citizens\u2019 lives, the other an unused 'Reconciliation Spiral' protocol for redeeming flagged citizens.",
  "dilemma": "Should Daria trigger the citywide release of Halden's secret intervention logs, exposing years of hidden abuses and risking public chaos, or quietly launch the 'Reconciliation Spiral', giving flagged citizens a second chance and repairing the system without confronting the past directly?",
  "reason": "Daria feels the weight of responsibility: leaking the logs will force the city to face painful truths and could incite turmoil, while releasing only the protocol might avoid chaos but leave old wounds unaddressed. Her technical access gives her the power to either reveal the truth or try to heal the system from within. Her conversations with Alex have made her question if Stenograd is ready to reckon with its history, or if hope is still possible through gradual reform.",
  "choice_a": "Release Halden\u2019s secret logs for all to see, exposing past abuses and igniting public demand for accountability.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Truth must come before healing, no matter the pain.",
    "Systems built on secrets cannot be reformed; they must be rebuilt.",
    "Responsibility means facing consequences, not covering them up."
  ],
  "choice_b": "Quietly activate the Reconciliation Spiral protocol, enabling flagged citizens to reintegrate and pursue new futures without exposing old wounds.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Change is safest when it heals, not destroys.",
    "People deserve a second chance, even if the full truth is delayed.",
    "Restoring trust happens through action, not only confession."
