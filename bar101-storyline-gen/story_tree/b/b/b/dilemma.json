  "dilemma": "With the city in turmoil and citizens searching for direction, Nikola Petrak must choose: share the simulation chip, prompting citywide debate about new possible futures, or distribute the spiral instructions, unleashing a risky wave of self-empowerment.",
  "reason": "Nikola knows both choices are dangerous. Sharing the simulation exposes truth and hope, but could destabilize what little order remains. Distributing the spiral gives people material power, but risks uncontrolled chaos and retaliation. As a lifelong harmonist and Council insider, he understands how easily either path could tip Stenograd into darkness\u2014or renewal.",
