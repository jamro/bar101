Initially, people parade through streets in masks, hoping for score recovery. But as a faulty BCI subroutine from an earlier update starts flagging small nonverbal cues, citizens are publicly shamed, removed from parades, or suddenly denied access to services mid-event. Mistrust and resentment spread, and masks become a shield, not a celebration. The festival devolves into a tense display of forced enthusiasm and growing paranoia, exposing fractures in authority and turning the city into a theater of artificial harmony.",
