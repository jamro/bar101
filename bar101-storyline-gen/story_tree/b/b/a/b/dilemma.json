  "trigger_event": "A bundle of undeveloped analog film and a thumb drive containing Halden\u2019s secret protocol and coded instructions is left for Rada, showing proof of the recently disappeared alive and hinting at the BCI's hidden vulnerabilities.",
  "dilemma": "Should Rada expose the evidence and stories of the disappeared to launch a citywide return and force transparency, or hide the proof and unleash only the cryptic ritual\u2014forcing the whole city into a painful reckoning?",
  "reason": "Exposing the evidence puts vulnerable citizens at risk but can restore families and pressure the system to change. Hiding the proof and releasing only the challenge could push everyone into direct confrontation with power, but risks deeper chaos and hardship. As a correspondent on both official and underground channels, Rada can directly shape public truth or push the city into creative resistance, but cannot do both.",
  "choice_a": "Reveal the protocol and photos, confirming the disappeared are alive and catalyzing their return\u2014forcing public recognition and reform, but risking new crackdowns.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Truth and reconciliation demand open exposure\u2014even if the system strikes back.",
    "Families deserve answers, not whispered ghosts.",
    "Change starts with vulnerable stories brought to light."
  ],
  "choice_b": "Release only the ritual instructions and encoded diary fragments, plunging the city and Council into confusion\u2014forcing collective action and survival games, denying the system an easy reset.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Systemic reckoning requires all to face the machinery of control, not just its victims.",
    "Direct pressure on the Council unlocks real change, not cautious exposure.",
    "Disruption forges solidarity and new networks of resistance."
