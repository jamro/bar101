When Marek Halden, the architect of this seamless order, is found dead in his sealed home, the city\u2019s machine-like calm begins to falter.

As his handwritten warnings uncannily predict citywide disruptions, apprehensive crowds gather, drawn by the hope of coded resistance or the fear of disaster. Tension crackles through the city as spontaneous assemblies erupt, the BCI\u2019s scores plummet, and authorities scramble to contain the chaos. The Council, fractured and desperate, debates silencing Halden\u2019s haunting words, but the city\u2019s trust is already broken\u2014leaving Stenograd teetering between anxious hope and sudden unrest."
