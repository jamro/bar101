  "trigger_event": "On the morning of June 9th, Lenart discovers a hidden archive of raw BCI logs and Council debates stored in a remote utility node, just as both neighborhood activists and a Council liaison ask for his help to either reveal or contain the information. After a late-night conversation with Alex, the bartender, his sense of responsibility and the weight of public trust press heavily on him.",
  "dilemma": "Lenart must decide whether to unleash the full truth to Stenograd by leaking the BCI\u2019s secrets citywide, risking an upheaval, or to instead help the Council channel the crisis into their controlled 'Redemption Games,' opting for managed repair and gradual reform.",
  "reason": "Lenart is torn because he knows exposure could destroy what\u2019s left of public trust but might be the only real shot at justice and change, while controlled reform feels safer but may only reinforce the same failing power structure. The memory of Alex's words\u2014about people deserving the truth, but also needing hope\u2014lingers powerfully in his mind.",
  "choice_a": "Lenart broadcasts the unfiltered BCI logs and secret Council arguments to every screen in Stenograd, forcing the truth into the open and triggering waves of outrage and public reckoning.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Only complete transparency breaks cycles of abuse.",
    "Citizens can handle\u2014even need\u2014the raw truth, no matter the risk.",
    "No reform is possible while secrets are kept by the powerful."
  ],
  "choice_b": "Lenart declines to leak the files, instead using his access to help the Council trigger the 'Redemption Games'\u2014releasing only the ritual challenges and driving communities to cooperative action instead of chaos.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Order and community must be protected from collapse.",
    "Change must happen step by step, not with a single shock.",
    "Guided reform, however flawed, is more humane than chaos."
