  "content": "In the tightly controlled city of Stenograd, where Marek Halden\u2019s Behavioral Compliance Index quietly governs every life, a crisis erupts when Halden is found dead and the system begins to falter. As panic spreads, technocrat Lenart Kova persuades the ruling Council to launch \u201cRedemption Games,\u201d pitting neighborhoods against each other in moral challenges to restore crucial services. Some communities unite under pressure, while others fracture amid rising suspicion and rivalry. But when Halden\u2019s coded diaries and BCI audit logs are leaked by Oksana Lintz, revealing dark secrets of forced disappearances, the city\u2019s simmering unrest explodes. Truth commissions emerge, protests swell, and the once-untouchable Council faces public reckoning. As records of the vanished resurface, the people of Stenograd are finally offered a choice: abolish the system altogether, or rebuild it with open, collective oversight\u2014leaving the city\u2019s fate in the hands of its citizens for the first time in years."
