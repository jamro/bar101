As critical services fail and trust loops break, Lenart Kova, a conflicted technocrat, secretly steers the Council toward a desperate experiment: 'Redemption Games' that pit neighborhoods against moral challenges to restore their access to everyday life. Some communities band together, rediscovering old solidarities, while others crack under the pressure, wracked by quarrels over ethics and sacrifice.
