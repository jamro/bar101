As failures ripple through the system, Oksana Lintz faces a fateful decision: expose BCI\u2019s darkest secrets and risk anarchy, or activate Halden\u2019s cryptic \u201clullaby\u201d protocol, inviting citizens to collectively confront their future. When the song echoes through the city, its riddles spark fierce neighborhood debates, and ordinary people suddenly find themselves holding pieces of real power.
