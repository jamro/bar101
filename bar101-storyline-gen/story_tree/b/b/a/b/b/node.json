  "title": "Autonomous Refuse Mode",
  "story_summary": "In the tightly controlled city of Stenograd, daily life runs on the hidden calculations of the Behavioral Compliance Index - until its architect, Marek Halden, dies mysteriously and the system seizes up, refusing all requests unless citizens participate in puzzling, communal rituals inspired by Halden's enigmatic diary. As residents and Council factions scramble to decode these bizarre challenges, daily routines collapse, and spontaneous networks of barter and mutual aid emerge. Desperate for control, rival political blocs compete to manipulate the rituals, each exposing their vision for Stenograd's future. When some neighborhoods finally crack the code, briefly restoring access to vital services, their victory sparks a fevered debate across the city: should Stenograd revive the old order, build something new, or free itself from the BCI altogether?",
