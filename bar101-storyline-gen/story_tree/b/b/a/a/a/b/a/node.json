  "title": "Ghost in the Loop",
  "story_summary": "In 2025, the city of Stenograd runs on the invisible logic of the Behavioral Compliance Index - a seamless system shaping lives with silent efficiency until Marek Halden, its architect, is found dead and the mechanism falters. Amid the uncertainty, Lenart Kova risks everything to leak damning BCI records uncovering a hidden legacy of disappearances, sparking public outrage and powerful testimonies from returned survivors. As nightly vigils swell and Council officials resign under pressure, trust in the city's automated rule collapses. Suddenly, strange system alerts - cryptically signed '-H' - begin predicting crises and subtly steering events, leaving citizens torn between fear and hope. Against mounting panic, Oksana broadcasts Halden's forgotten vision: the BCI was meant to serve, never control. As Stenograd stands at a crossroads, its people must decide whether to destroy the system's ghost or finally claim their right to shape its purpose, confronting a future where technology and humanity are inseparably entwined.",
