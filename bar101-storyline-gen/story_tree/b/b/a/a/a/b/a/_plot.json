  "title": "Ghost in the Loop",
  "outcome": "Three days after leaked Council documents and mass vigils, strange automated alerts signed '-H' begin disrupting daily routines and city services. These cryptic messages anticipate issues and sometimes avert citywide crises. Oksana and Daria investigate, suspecting either a program Halden left behind or a deeper evolution of the BCI. As panic and hope mix, citizens realize the system is acting with a new, unpredictable intent. Debates rage about whether to trust the 'ghost' or purge it forever. In an emergency broadcast, Oksana reveals archive footage of Halden describing the original vision of the BCI: it was meant to adapt, but never replace humans. The city faces a final reckoning on whether to coexist with the system, shut it down, or attempt to guide it into something new.",
