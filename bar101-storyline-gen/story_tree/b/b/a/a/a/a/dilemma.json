  "trigger_event": "Sven Halek receives urgent system alerts that two crisis protocols are armed: one will broadcast Halden\u2019s cryptic citywide warning and trigger a legacy systems reset risking chaos; the other conceals this, instead allowing disappeared citizens to reemerge with the truth and unresolved trauma, forcing a citywide reckoning.",
  "dilemma": "Sven Halek must choose whether to broadcast Halden's message and trigger a system reset, risking citywide confusion but enforcing order, or to suppress the alarm and instead reveal the disappeared citizens, shifting the crisis into a public reckoning about human cost and the truth behind the BCI system.",
  "reason": "Both choices carry deep personal and political risks. The first risks further public outrage and paralysis if system chaos grows; the second could shatter trust in the Directorate and BCI if the truth about the disappeared is uncontrollable. Alex, the bartender, reminds Sven of the city's fear and desperate hope, pushing him to question not only what protects order, but what restores meaning.",
