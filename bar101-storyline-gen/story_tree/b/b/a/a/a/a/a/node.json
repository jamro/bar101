  "title": "The Echo Protocol",
  "story_summary": "In the near-future city of Stenograd, life is ruled not by politicians but by a system - the Behavioral Compliance Index (BCI) - that quietly scores every citizen, shaping daily existence. Marek Halden, the system's reclusive architect, dies mysteriously, sending the city's invisible machinery into turmoil. Fearing chaos, the powerful Directorate silences all civilian digital communication, sparking an underground wave of handwritten notes and whispered messages that knit citizens together. When lists of the recently disappeared are leaked, neighbors band together, searching for those whisked from BCI watchlists, undermining trust in the ruling Council. Soon, automated messages eerily signed by the late Halden haunt Council members' inboxes, deepening paranoia as the city's BCI scores fluctuate and protests erupt, demanding to uncover the algorithms behind each life's invisible judgment. As one bold leak reveals the unfair truths driving the scores, neighborhoods unite, rewriting the rules and sparking boundary clashes as rival systems take hold. Just as chaos threatens to split Stenograd apart, a cryptic posthumous warning from Halden plays citywide, forcing Council, citizens, and engineers to decode his final intent. In the uneasy peace that follows, citizens and officials together forge a new, fragile social contract, Stenograd forever changed by the choices of both its people and its silent systems.",
