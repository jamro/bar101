  "outcome": "Hundreds of disappeared citizens reemerge, traumatized and oddly synchronized, hinting at hidden programming or exposure to secret protocols. Their presence inflames debate: are they victims, threats, or cautionary evidence of BCI\u2019s darkest experiments? Assemblies and Council members must decide their place, leading to a referendum on reintegration and justice. The vanished return becomes a symbol of reckoning with Halden\u2019s ultimate legacy and the consequences of power unchecked.",
