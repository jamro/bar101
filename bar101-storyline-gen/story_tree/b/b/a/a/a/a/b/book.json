Without warning, hundreds of citizens who had vanished\u2014presumed lost to the system\u2019s labyrinth\u2014suddenly reappear, unified by strange behaviors and haunted by memories of secret psychological tests. The city reels in shock; forums erupt with fear and hope as residents question whether these returnees are victims or hidden threats. As debate rages about justice and the dangers of unchecked algorithms, Council members and anxious citizens face a turning point: a sweeping referendum that will determine the fate of the traumatized returnees and the future limits of Stenograd\u2019s machine-driven rule. In the end, the city is forced to confront the very humanity its flawless governance nearly erased."
