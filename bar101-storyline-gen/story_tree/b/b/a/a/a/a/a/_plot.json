Multiple backup BCI subsystems reactivate, creating system chaos as regions enforce conflicting rules. Engineers, Council members, and citizen groups must work together to decode Halden\u2019s intent, halt feedback loops, and forge an uneasy peace. Past Council power struggles and Halden\u2019s secret authority reframe his death as a last attempt to guide Stenograd through its most dangerous test.",
