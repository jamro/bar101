  "title": "Social Trust Trial",
  "outcome": "Responding to rising outrage and Council collapse, the city suspends the BCI for a three-week 'social trust trial.' With scores frozen and many checkpoints deactivated, neighborhoods self-organize, reshaping daily routines around cooperation. Former divisions between high- and low-score citizens blur as they share resources. Council members, scrambling to regain relevance, attempt to steer public opinion through official broadcasts. However, as halt period nears its end, deep rifts surface over whether to restore the system. Innovators and frustrated citizens begin drafting alternative models, while Directorate loyalists push for a rapid return to order.",
