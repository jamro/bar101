  "title": "Social Trust Trial",
  "story_summary": "In Stenograd, a city governed by the algorithmic Behavioral Compliance Index, order was shaped not by politics but by the silent logic of data. When Marek Halden, the system's architect, was found dead and the Council's grip wavered, Rada Miskovic seized her chance: leaking explosive dossiers that exposed the Council's secrets and betrayals, fueling outrage and fracturing the powerful factions. Protests erupted as citizens demanded real democracy, forcing the Council into chaos. In desperation, Oksana Lintz persuaded them to suspend the all-seeing BCI for a three-week 'social trust trial,' allowing residents to organize themselves and old divisions to dissolve. Yet as communities thrived and debate over Stenograd's future heated up, the city stood on the knife-edge - caught between the return of cold automation or daring to trust a new, human-driven order.",
