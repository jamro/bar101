When Marek Halden, the system\u2019s architect, was found dead and the Council\u2019s grip wavered, Rada Miskovic seized her chance: leaking explosive dossiers that exposed the Council\u2019s secrets and betrayals, fueling outrage and fracturing the powerful factions. Protests erupted as citizens demanded real democracy, forcing the Council into chaos. In desperation, Oksana Lintz persuaded them to suspend the all-seeing BCI for a three-week \u2018social trust trial,\u2019 allowing residents to organize themselves and old divisions to dissolve. Yet as communities thrived and debate over Stenograd\u2019s future heated up, the city stood on the knife-edge\u2014caught between the return of cold automation or daring to trust a new, human-driven order."
