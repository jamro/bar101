  "title": "Restored Order Crackdown",
  "story_summary": "In 2025, Stenograd runs on the invisible logic of the Behavioral Compliance Index, its citizens guided and judged by algorithms rather than leaders - until the mysterious death of Marek Halden, the system's brilliant architect, throws everything into chaos. As BCI functions falter and unrest rises, Oksana Lintz urges the city's hardline Directorate to seize control, leading to a harsh crackdown: dissenters are publicly detained, BCI restrictions tighten, and propaganda floods the airwaves demanding obedience. Yet this iron grip only stokes resistance - ordinary people slip past digital checkpoints using clever tricks, while cracks split the ruling Council, pitting reformers against enforcers. With swelling protests outside government chambers and the system's future uncertain, Stenograd's struggle reveals both the fragility of algorithmic order and the resilience of a city unwilling to be ruled by machines alone.",
