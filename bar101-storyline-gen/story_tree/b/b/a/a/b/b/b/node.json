  "title": "Chain Reaction",
  "story_summary": "In the rigorously ordered city of Stenograd, where compliance is measured by the omnipresent Behavioral Compliance Index, chaos erupts after the mysterious death of its architect, Marek Halden. Faced with growing turmoil and a faltering system, technocrat Daria Tomenko, with quiet aid from activist Rada Miskovic, secretly revives Halden's predictive engine, swiftly restoring order and harmony. But as life smooths and queues vanish, the city's creative pulse fades - artists and freethinkers subtly erased by a system that fears unpredictability. Dissent stirs in whispered protests and shadowy graffiti, forcing Stenograd's leaders and citizens to reckon with an unsettling choice: serene stability or the messy, vital spirit of human originality.",
