As glitching subsystems sow unease, security chief Sven Halek pushes the Council to silence all civilian digital communications, plunging daily life into an anxious quiet. Deprived of news and connection, citizens revive old ways\u2014passing notes and whispered rumors\u2014while leaked fragments of debate between Halden and a Council member fuel suspicion. When the city erupts in a silent protest, trust in authority shatters, and soon, flyers exposing lists of the disappeared blanket public spaces. Spurred to action, neighborhoods band together, searching for those erased from BCI records; their efforts culminate in the return of several dazed citizens whose furtive accounts of secret jails deepen the crisis. As fear gives way to collective resolve and fractured loyalty, public faith in the once-infallible Council and its machine governance finally breaks."
