  "dilemma": "Nikola must decide whether to pull a secret lever that will reboot the system into its old, rigid protocols\u2014restoring order but reviving BCI\u2019s harshest, outdated standards\u2014or slip the means for a risky algorithmic fix to trusted Innovator allies, potentially unleashing unpredictable social upheaval.",
  "reason": "Nikola knows neither option is safe: one means immediate stability at great social cost, the other risks disorder but offers a chance for genuine adaptation. His history with the Council, sense of personal responsibility, and wary trust in progress all weigh heavily\u2014as does the memory of Alex\u2019s warning that sometimes an honest mess is better than a beautiful lie.",

    "Real progress requires risk\u2014even if it means temporary instability.",
    "The city won\u2019t survive unless the system evolves.",
