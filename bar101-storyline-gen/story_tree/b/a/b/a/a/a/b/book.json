Daria Tomenko, burdened with damning evidence against the Council, chooses compassion over chaos, urging leaders to suspend their powers and embrace a citywide \"Festival of Closure.\" As the streets fill with communal rituals, shared meals, and heartfelt forums, citizens mourn together, building new bridges across old divides. Guided by hidden messages from Halden, the people find empathy in unexpected places, and for two weeks, the machinery of control falls silent. When the festival ends, Stenograd\u2019s residents elect a representative assembly, dissolving both the oppressive BCI and the old Council\u2014finally reclaiming their city and closing the chapter on algorithmic rule."
