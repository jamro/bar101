  "content": "In 2025, the city of Stenograd thrives under the shadow of the Behavioral Compliance Index (BCI), a powerful system that quietly shapes every life by scoring obedience and granting or denying access to daily essentials. When Marek Halden\u2014the BCI's enigmatic architect\u2014dies mysteriously, the city\u2019s seamless order fragments, forcing the Council to suspend BCI control and let citizens manage their own neighborhoods. Amidst the chaos and hope of newfound freedom, strange coins bearing embedded data linked to vanished citizens begin surfacing, exposing silent erasures and inciting outrage. As citizens rally for answers, more coins appear, now pulsing with guidance and messages from the lost, thanks to a hidden network Halden built before his death. The city splits between those welcoming the vanished and those clinging to the familiar comfort of algorithmic rule. To regain legitimacy, the Council calls for a referendum, but vanished voices sway the outcome toward continued self-organization. When a final flood of Halden\u2019s secret recordings reveals years of Council corruption, the city erupts in protest, toppling old rulers and ushering in a leaderless, hope-filled era where the vanished and visible rebuild Stenograd together."
