The city feels louder, but the official messages are quieter, less reliable. I\u2019ve started updating Innovator talking points by hand, just to keep them current. Even small decisions feel heavy. No, it\u2019s not steady. Not for me."

Most evenings, I rewrite the Innovators\u2019 lines by candlelight, ignoring the monitors on my trail. You know, it\u2019s easier to listen than to direct these days. The uncertainty is exhausting. Feels like I\u2019m drifting, not driving anything."

Now, after that referendum, with my access flagged and my group dissected, I walk from forum to forum writing down words for Innovators who don\u2019t really lead anymore. At night, I record what I hear by hand, because the channels I built my life around barely breathe. They monitor me for being too present, too curious, and my score keeps bleeding away. Sometimes I think the only thing left steady is the fear in people\u2019s eyes. I can shape words for them or anyone, but I can\u2019t steady myself\u2014no one can."
