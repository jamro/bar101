  "outcome": "Three days after the latest coin revelations, a new wave of data coins appears throughout the city, now showing evolving personal messages and guidance from vanished citizens. As deciphering these coins becomes a citywide phenomenon, the Council discovers that Halden implanted a hidden peer-to-peer network in the system back in 2023. The network, now activated, lets the vanished communicate with the public and orchestrate encrypted acts of civil aid. The city divides between those who follow the guidance of the vanished and those still loyal to algorithmic order, as Council factions scramble to respond.",
