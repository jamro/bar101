  "trigger_event": "Lenart uncovers two dormant emergency overrides in the city\u2019s network \u2014 one enabling a public, monitored referendum, the other triggering a citywide broadcast giving the vanished a direct voice. Both can\u2019t run at once.",
  "dilemma": "Lenart must decide whether to stabilize the city by launching a monitored referendum\u2014channeling public anger into an orderly process under watchful eyes\u2014or to unleash a bold, uncontrolled broadcast that gives the vanished citizens a platform to speak directly to everyone, risking chaos but breaking the Council\u2019s hold on the narrative.",
  "reason": "Lenart is torn because either path will define Stenograd\u2019s future: one could restore order but reinforce the powers that failed; the other could burst the dam for change, but bring unpredictable unrest and endanger him personally. His talks with Alex, the bartender, remind him of the hope and the fear threaded through ordinary lives\u2014making the weight of choice feel personal, not abstract.",
  "choice_a": "Authorize the monitored citywide referendum, letting citizens choose between system control and community self-rule, with oversight to keep order even as the city debates openly.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Order, even flawed, is better than unpredictable chaos.",
    "Giving people a voice within structure avoids disaster.",
    "Enduring systems matter more than sudden revolutions."

  "choice_b": "Trigger the network broadcast, letting the vanished\u2019s messages hijack every city screen\u2014forcing the Council\u2019s failures into the open and making the invisible seen, even if order unravels.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Truth must break free, no matter the cost to stability.",
    "Only unfiltered voices can restore trust.",
    "Rigged order is worse than righteous chaos."
