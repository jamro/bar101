  "title": "Echoes of Halden",
  "story_summary": "In the tightly controlled city of Stenograd, where the Behavioral Compliance Index quietly shapes every life and the vanished are quietly erased, rebellion brews beneath the surface. When engineer Lenart Kova hijacks the city's screens to broadcast haunting images - merging the faces of missing citizens and Council leaders - the city jolts awake, spiraling into protest, investigation, and creative unrest as families unite to demand answers. Within the chaos, Daria Tomenko uncovers and activates the late BCI architect Marek Halden's hidden program, 'Echoes,' which floods the city with fragmented messages urging collective self-rule. As glitches mirror Halden's vision of decentralized governance, citizens form neighborhood assemblies, and the Council, faced with system collapse and mounting public will, surrenders control, leaving Stenograd's future in the people's hands for the first time.",
