  "content": "In 2025, the tightly controlled city of Stenograd is shaken when Marek Halden, architect of the all-powerful Behavioral Compliance Index (BCI), is found dead, destabilizing the seemingly flawless system that governs every aspect of life. As unrest mounts and vanished citizens reappear amid public outrage, Council member Sven Halek proposes a bold citywide tribunal, inviting everyone to testify about BCI injustices. Grief and long-buried betrayals surface as neighborhoods erupt with stories of manipulation and disappearances, fracturing both the population and the Council itself. In the chaos that follows, central authority collapses, forcing local assemblies and community leaders\u2014guided in part by Sven and Oksana\u2014to take control of essential services. Some districts thrive through collaboration, while others falter amid old feuds and scarcity, until volunteers and previously invisible citizens step up to broker uneasy truces. Ultimately, hope flickers as united neighborhoods call for a public, transparent federation, offering a vision for a freer, more human future beyond the shadow of the BCI."
