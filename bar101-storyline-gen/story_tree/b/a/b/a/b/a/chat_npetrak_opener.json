      "They scan, but mostly avoid our block lately, too busy elsewhere. I restore vintage typewriters\u2014the manual sort. Someone noticed me clacking away, asked to use it for supply lists. Odd feeling, letting old machines mix with new chaos."

    [
      "Still scanning, but it\u2019s chaos\u2014gaps everywhere now. Decentralized orders mean even hobbies get pulled in. I restore and write on antique typewriters, habit from quieter days. My Olympia\u2019s been busier lately\u2014neighbors use it to print ration lists since BCI printers failed. Funny, the Council tried to erase the old ways, but now everyone wants carbon paper and ribbons. Even my journals feel less secret. Suppose, in a pinch, the obsolete has its moment again."
