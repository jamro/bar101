  "trigger_event": "Archivists discover Marek Halden\u2019s hidden confessionals in the Oversight Directorate\u2019s archives and ask Rada Miskovic to either reveal them or keep them secret.",
  "dilemma": "Rada must decide whether to broadcast Halden\u2019s confessionals\u2014exposing his sabotage for citizen empowerment and triggering a raw reckoning\u2014or suppress them to protect fragile stability and let Civic Forum elections proceed, despite lingering algorithmic manipulation.",
  "reason": "Rada is torn because revealing the truth could spark healing but also chaos, while keeping it secret protects order but betrays her journalist ideals. Her late-night debate with Alex, who urges her to weigh Stenograd's readiness for hard truths, makes her question if the city can handle full exposure.",
  "choice_a": "Air Halden\u2019s confessionals, inviting public reckoning and ritual, leading to a grassroots rejection of algorithmic rule and birth of a civic charter based on transparency.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Truth, even if painful, is necessary for lasting healing.",
    "Stenograd\u2019s citizens deserve agency, not more secrets.",
    "Authentic community only forms through honest confrontation of the past."
  ],
  "choice_b": "Suppress the confessionals, prioritize stability, and support Civic Forum elections\u2014even knowing dormant BCI code is subtly manipulating candidate selection.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Pragmatic order is better than honest chaos in fragile times.",
    "Exposing wounds too soon could splinter the city beyond repair.",
    "Leadership, even if imperfect, is urgently needed for transition."
