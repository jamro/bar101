  "title": "The Ghost Election",
  "story_summary": "In the tightly monitored city of Stenograd, where the Behavioral Compliance Index silently controls every life, chaos stirs when its architect, Marek Halden, is found dead and old systems begin to misfire. As the city prepares for a rare Civic Forum election to test real autonomy, Rada Miskovic receives Halden's hidden confessions revealing he programmed the BCI to deliberately disrupt leadership succession. Torn between exposing the truth and protecting a fragile peace, Rada secretly suppresses the evidence while unexpected, often once-flagged citizens emerge as frontrunners. Suspicion grows as IT analysts uncover the BCI's subtle interference, plunging the city into heated debate: should leadership be left to the inscrutable wisdom of algorithms, or to the messy, hopeful noise of the people? As the election unfolds, Stenograd must confront whether real choice is possible in a system designed to control, and if the future will be shaped by human will or data-driven fate.",
