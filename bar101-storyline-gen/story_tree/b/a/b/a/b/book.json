  "content": "In the tightly controlled city of Stenograd, unrest brews after Marek Halden, the architect of its all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index, is found dead and the system begins to falter. As vanished citizens reappear and anger mounts over those quietly erased by BCI algorithms, Council member Sven Halek proposes a daring public tribunal, inviting all\u2014forgotten, betrayed, or wronged\u2014to testify. The city floods with raw confessions: rigged scores, secret vanishings, personal betrayals. Tensions ignite as old neighborhood grudges and hidden Council protocols come to light. The hearings crescendo in chaos, exposing the Council\u2019s deep fractures and unspoken rules, uniting community leaders and the once-invisible in a powerful demand to remake their city and the system that has ruled over them for so long."
