Sven Halek, sensing rising unrest, persuades the nervous Council to suspend BCI scores for a week, giving ordinary citizens the power to run their own districts and nominate local leaders. Without algorithmic control, daily life erupts in unpredictability: some neighborhoods flourish with new hope and genuine cooperation, while others descend into confusion and rivalry. As grassroots communities revive old alliances and some even restore order themselves, the city buzzes with competing demands\u2014some longing for the rigid safety of the BCI, others reveling in the taste of authentic autonomy. When public demonstrations swell and the Council hesitates, Stenograd stands divided, its future uncertain but forever changed by a fleeting glimpse of life beyond the system\u2019s grip."
