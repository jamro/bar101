  "trigger_event": "While helping a district health hub recover from BCI blackout, Daria discovers two concealed data caches: one tied to physical coins holding lost citizen data, the other a digital journal foreseeing Council unrest. She knows she can't release both without exposing her identity and losing all access.",
  "dilemma": "Should Daria reveal the mysterious coins, giving the public undeniable proof about the fate of the vanished and risking mass upheaval, or secretly hand the Council\u2019s journal to internal authorities, sparking controlled internal chaos but keeping most citizens unaware?",
  "reason": "Daria is torn because both choices are irreversible and dangerous: going public with the coins could shatter what\u2019s left of social trust, but keeping the secret in the hands of the Council could let the truth be buried forever. As her job gives her unique access, her next action will have citywide impact.",
