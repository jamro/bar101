  "trigger_event": "Late at night, Daria watches an exhausted nurse lead a spontaneous food drive for ghosted neighbors. The system unexpectedly surges their BCI scores, and the news spreads instantly online, stirring hope and confusion.",
  "dilemma": "Daria must choose whether to fully enable the forgotten empathy protocol, letting it shape the city and foster a wave of communal support, or trigger a system reset to erase corrupted profiles despite the risk of turning hundreds into digital ghosts.",
  "reason": "Daria fears that enabling empathy rewards could lead to manipulation and chaos, but also knows that a mass reset erases innocent lives\u2014including people like herself. Both choices carry social and ethical risks, and she hesitates to place her own hope or fear above what the city might need.",
  "choice_a": "Activate the dormant empathy protocol and allow BCI to reward acts of compassion citywide.",
  "belief_a": [

    "Survival depends on building trust, especially between outcasts."
