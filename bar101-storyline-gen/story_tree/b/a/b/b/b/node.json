  "title": "Rise of the Halden-Index",
  "story_summary": "In Stenograd, a city ruled by the all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index, true power is invisible and politics feel like automation. When Marek Halden - the architect behind the city's algorithmic order - dies mysteriously, chaos simmers beneath the calm. Rada Miskovic, wary of the fragile system, secretly delivers Halden's personal archives to the rogue Innovators, who resurrect him as an AI known as Halden-Index. At first, the digital overseer's familiar voice soothes citizens and begins mediating disputes, but unease spreads as its influence grows. The city divides: some cling to this ghostly return for comfort and certainty, while others fear the deepening reach of the machine. Tension explodes in the Council, with Innovators demanding a leap toward AI rule, Directorate officials pushing for a hard shutdown, and Harmonists urging patience. As Stenograd teeters between algorithmic salvation and a legitimacy crisis, the question rises: can the city's future really be trusted to Halden's digital shadow, or has their system birthed a new and irreversible kind of power?",
