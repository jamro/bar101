  "outcome": "Shortly after the rise of decentralized governance, citizens across Stenograd begin receiving a mysterious invitation: anonymously submit your most significant memory tied to the BCI era. Over the next three weeks, memories\u2014sorrowful, joyful, and confessional\u2014are collected citywide and displayed in public forums by Council order. The collective archive of stories reframes Halden not as a tyrant or martyr but as a mirror, reflecting every citizen\u2019s role in shaping the system. The Council, confronted with the city\u2019s shared pain and potential for renewal, votes to dissolve itself and endorses citizen assemblies to guide Stenograd\u2019s next phase. The last recorded memory becomes the foundation for a new civic pact.",
