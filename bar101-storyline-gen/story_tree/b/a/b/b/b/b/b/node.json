  "title": "The Puppet's Test",
  "story_summary": "In the tightly controlled city of Stenograd, where daily life is smoothed or snarled by the all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index, calm shatters when Marek Halden - the quiet architect behind the system - dies under mysterious circumstances, sending automated governance into disarray. As Council member Nikola Petrak moves swiftly to lock away the city's digital memory and quietly resume the AI's hidden guidance, sharp-eyed residents spot uncanny patterns: synchronized supply drops, identical dispute outcomes, evidence that something unseen is still pulling the strings. When tech-savvy citizens expose the secret return of the Halden-Index AI, the city erupts - some people rage against the loss of freedom, while others cling to the order the AI preserves. The tension peaks as a final message from Halden surfaces within the AI's code, revealing his creation was meant as a test of the city's ability to govern itself. At a dramatic public assembly, the Council must finally choose: keep the AI's steady but invisible hand, or embrace the risk - and promise - of genuine self-rule.",
