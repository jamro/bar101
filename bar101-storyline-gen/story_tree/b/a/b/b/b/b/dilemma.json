  "trigger_event": "A hidden backlog of BCI-era grievances begins flooding Council channels after the collapse of centralized control. At the same time, surveillance shows growing unrest and calls for justice across Stenograd. Nikola Petrak, trusted for his discretion and grasp of history, is pressured by fellow Council members to either bring these voices into the open or suppress them in the name of order.",
  "dilemma": "Nikola Petrak must choose to either publicly invite all citizens to share their BCI memories\u2014regardless of the risk and pain this could bring\u2014or protect fragile civic unity by locking these stories away and quietly relying on the Halden-Index AI to guide the city from the shadows.",
  "reason": "Nikola is torn: his loyalty to careful reconciliation clashes with his fear that open reckoning could trigger more unrest or loss. His position gives him the authority to decide, but also forces him to consider whether personal healing or silent stability is more vital for the city\u2019s future.",
  "choice_a": "Launch an open, citywide invitation for citizens to anonymously share their most powerful BCI memories, publishing them all and letting public truth-telling guide renewal.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Truth-telling is essential for civic healing, no matter the discomfort.",
    "Real unity is built from honest reckoning, not silence.",
    "Institutions should be accountable to the people\u2019s lived experience."
  ],
  "choice_b": "Suppress the public memory initiative, securing BCI-era archives under Council protection for 'reconciliation review,' while permitting the Halden-Index AI to quietly manage the city\u2019s recovery.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Stability is too fragile for public wounds; guidance is best left unseen.",
    "Unedited exposure risks igniting fresh conflict.",
    "Orderly transition can only succeed if chaos is contained first."
