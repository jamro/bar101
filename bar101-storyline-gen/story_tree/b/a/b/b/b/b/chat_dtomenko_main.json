No more central oversight, just handwritten lists, and I have to judge what\u2019s real without records. There was this argument\u2014two districts wanted the same stock of wristbands. I risked upsetting everyone and just split them evenly, turned down requests with sketchy histories. Even so, the locals acted like I was picking sides. My BCI score dropped because of my decisions and now every day I walk in, it\u2019s riskier. All that pressure\u2014sometimes I wonder how much longer it\u2019ll last."

At the lab, my work is only as good as my judgment now\u2014no requests logged, no centralized oversight, just people demanding things face-to-face. I spent the week splitting up a too-small supply of health bands, refusing whoever couldn\u2019t show a real need, even if it made me enemies. The local power brokers don\u2019t trust me, but I won\u2019t just pick a side. My BCI keeps sliding. Funny, isn\u2019t it? I signed up hoping tech would fix things. Now all that innovation is twisted\u2014just more human mess, less control each day. It\u2019s\u2014hard, just trying to stay useful when everything feels so exposed."
