  "dilemma": "Should Rada broadcast the full, uncensored contents of Halden's journals\u2014revealing hidden BCI fail-safes and warnings, risking chaos but empowering citizens\u2014or comply with Council orders for strict censorship, preserving fragile order but fueling authoritarian responses?",
  "reason": "Rada is torn: full disclosure could inspire hope and a new civic awakening, but might also provoke violence against her or trigger a crackdown. Suppressing the truth could keep the peace or deliver it to the Directorate, leaving her complicit in further repression.",
  "choice_a": "Reveal Halden's full, uncensored archives and urge public debate, sparking citizen empowerment and fracturing Council control.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Truth, even painful, is the only hope for real reform.",
    "People must decide with all the facts\u2014secrecy only leads to more control.",
    "If the Council\u2019s legitimacy is gone, only transparency can offer a new start."

  "choice_b": "Comply with Council orders and release only heavily edited, reassuring fragments, helping reinforce fragile order and enabling a Directorate crackdown.",
  "belief_b": [
    "City stability matters more than risky truth in crisis moments.",
    "Unfiltered revelations will trigger chaos and put innocents at risk.",
    "Sometimes, protecting people means withholding what would cause harm."
