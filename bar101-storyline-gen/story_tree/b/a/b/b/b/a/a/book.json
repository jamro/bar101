  "content": "In the hyper-ordered city of Stenograd, life is quietly governed by the omnipresent Behavioral Compliance Index, a system built by the enigmatic Marek Halden. When Halden is found dead and the city\u2019s routines begin to crumble, chaos looms as rival Council factions vie for control. Desperate to restore stability, Innovators use Halden\u2019s digital footprints to revive him as an AI overseer, whose familiar voice divides the city; some hail his return while others shudder at the implications. As conflict deepens, a citywide referendum on the AI\u2019s future is marred by technical glitches and suspicion, leading the AI to self-suspend, declaring, \u201cLegitimacy must be earned.\u201d With leadership in crisis, Halden\u2019s personal journals emerge, revealing hidden safeguards and unheeded warnings. Inspired, citizens\u2014led by voices like Oksana\u2014organize public forums and dismantle the old Council, forging a new assembly that champions transparency, cooperation, and human agency over algorithmic rule."
