  "title": "Council Journal of Future Days",
  "story_summary": "In Stenograd, a city ruled not by politicians but by algorithms and the all-powerful Behavioral Compliance Index, the sudden death of Marek Halden - the system's quiet architect - throws everything off balance. When Daria Tomenko secretly delivers an encrypted Council journal, filled with Halden's eerie, future-dated predictions about policy shifts and unrest, the city's elite are thrown into turmoil. As rumors of the journal leak, paranoia spreads from the Council down to the citizens, who begin to question their future and organize protests in anticipation of disaster. On the day of the final prophecy, when the Council boldly defies what was predicted, the city erupts in confusion and celebration, leaving trust in their once-invisible system shattered and the future of Stenograd uncertain.",
