  "title": "Testimony of the Teachers",
  "story_summary": "In a city quietly ruled by the all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index, life proceeds with automated fairness until unexpected disruption shakes the system. When Marek Halden, the architect of Stenograd's ubiquitous control network, is found dead under mysterious circumstances, glitches ripple through the city. Amid rising uncertainty, sidelined teachers step forward, transforming classrooms into forums and sparking citywide assemblies where citizens share their hidden stories and debate the city's future. With the Council anxious to restore stability, Sven Halek boldly proposes using official media to legitimize these gatherings, turning teachers into catalysts for unity. As assemblies multiply and generations speak freely, a tide of empathy and solidarity sweeps Stenograd. Eventually, thousands gather in the city's heart to unveil a manifesto demanding transparent, participatory government, breaking the silence and daring the Council to answer a new call for democracy.",
