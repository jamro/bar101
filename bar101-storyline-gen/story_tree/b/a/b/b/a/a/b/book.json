Oksana Lintz, disturbed by what she uncovers in Halden\u2019s private notebook, defies protocol to demand a rare act of transparency: a citizens\u2019 jury drawn from every layer of compliance.

When the jury\u2019s inconclusive findings ignite passionate debate about blame and forgiveness, Stenograd fractures: council factions, grassroots leaders, and those once rendered invisible all vying to define the city\u2019s next chapter, as trust in the omnipresent system crumbles and a battle for the future quietly begins."
