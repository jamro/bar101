  "dilemma": "Should Sven advise the Council to double down on policing authenticity, intensifying pressure to act 'genuinely,' or should he leak details of a radical system inversion, throwing BCI scoring into chaos and shattering old hierarchies?",
  "reason": "Sven is torn because one path means controlling fear, but deepening suspicion and anxiety, while the other risks total disruption, with no promise of order or legitimacy afterward.",

    "Order is preferable to chaos, even if uncomfortable.",
    "People adapt best when rules are clear and consequences certain.",
    "A stable system, even if imperfect, keeps the city from collapse."

  "choice_b": "Leak evidence of the dormant 'reverse index' to key activists, prompting mass BCI score reversals and forcing the city to confront its broken sense of fairness.",

    "Systemic disruption is necessary for renewal.",
    "Realignment creates opportunities for true reform.",
