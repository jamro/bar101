  "title": "Score Sabotage Unleashed",
  "story_summary": "In the tightly regulated city of Stenograd, life depends on the Behavioral Compliance Index - an all-seeing system that quietly shapes every citizen's fate. When Marek Halden, creator of the BCI, is found dead, the city's seamless order unravels overnight. Oksana Lintz scrambles to quarantine a spreading flaw, but without manual overrides, chaos erupts: doctors are sent to sweep streets while dissidents run hospitals, sparking confusion and outrage. As the Council's factions argue and trust crumbles, hundreds of citizens once erased from the system emerge, slipping through surveillance to form shadow networks that deliver aid and disrupt routines. Desperate to restore control, authorities clamp down, but hackers turn the BCI against itself - scores shift wildly, alliances shatter, and the city plunges into suspicion. In the end, Stenograd stands divided, its faith in the system broken, its future uncertain.",
