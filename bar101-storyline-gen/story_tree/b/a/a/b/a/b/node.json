  "title": "Score Amnesia Plague",
  "story_summary": "In the tightly managed city of Stenograd, where every citizen's life is governed by the all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index, disillusioned administrator Daria Tomenko makes a daring choice: haunted by her brother's fate, she triggers a data erasure that wipes thousands of BCI profiles overnight. Suddenly invisible to the system, these citizens lose access to jobs and homes, chaos rippling through the city. But from confusion, resilience grows - those erased forge new 'amnesiac' communities grounded in trust, while black markets for fake identities thrive beneath the Council's watchful gaze. Attempts to restore order only fuel solidarity and underground defiance; soon, even compliant citizens quietly support the outcasts. With old controls breaking and spontaneous mutual aid blossoming across Stenograd, the Council's iron grip weakens, and a spirit of open resistance kindles citywide, promising new life beyond the algorithms.",
