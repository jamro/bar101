As panic spread and the stranded \u201camnesiacs\u201d found themselves denied work, shelter, and services, they banded together, building grassroots communities stitched by trust and barter, while a new black market for identities flourished beneath the Council\u2019s watch. The Council\u2019s heavy-handed attempts at control only deepened resistance; soon, these resilient citizens ignored BCI mandates altogether, inspiring open defiance citywide. Pressured by growing assemblies and her own conscience, Daria leaked confidential BCI and Council archives, exposing the regime\u2019s abuses to every corner of the city. Residents flooded public forums, confronting former technocrats and demanding accountability in open debate. Through passionate assemblies, amnesty sessions, and hard-won consensus, ordinary people dismantled the last vestiges of algorithmic power, publicly rejecting their old oppressors and, with newfound unity, celebrated the Mosaic Manifesto\u2014a triumphant return of civic life to the hands of the citizens themselves."
