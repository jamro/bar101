She\u2019s spent hours voicing her dilemma with Alex, the bartender, whose tough questions force her to weigh the city\u2019s need for open truth against the chaos that might follow.",
  "dilemma": "Rada must choose: broadcast Halden\u2019s secret archive and ignite massive public reckoning, or use the blackout script to plunge the city into 24 hours of BCI silence, giving others a chance to step up and reset power. Both are irreversible \u2014 one triggers a collective trial by evidence, the other a blank-slate civic experiment.",
  "reason": "Rada knows the weight of either action: direct exposure may lead to mob justice or hope, while a blackout gives the 'invisible' a voice but risks disorder and violence. Her job gives her access and authority, but her rebel instincts and outsider\u2019s insight\u2013sharpened by conversations with Alex\u2013leave her torn over which upheaval the city truly needs.",
