  "title": "Day Without Scores",
  "story_summary": "In the stark, engineered city of Stenograd, where the all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index quietly rules every aspect of life, engineer Rada Miskovic sparks upheaval after a night of debate, choosing to shut down the city's algorithm for a single day. As the BCI goes dark, stunned citizens band together, improvising new rules and finding trust in each other, while hidden voices rise with a manifesto exposing years of Council-ordered erasures. When the system flickers back to life, it unexpectedly rewards those who fostered community, turning former order against fresh local leaders and igniting a citywide movement that challenges the very core of technocratic control.",
