  "trigger_event": "During citywide unrest and ongoing BCI malfunctions, Daria intercepts an urgent Council directive: deploy a software update either revealing the system\u2019s workings to the public or wiping the records of thousands of citizens flagged by recent hacks. Both choices are irreversible and crisis-driven.",
  "dilemma": "Daria must either upload a partially-open BCI system update to the public, presenting a sanitized kind of 'transparency,' or authorize a mass deletion of BCI profiles\u2014erasing citizen identities, status, and histories but creating space for new social structures.",
  "reason": "Daria knows one action keeps the system shaky but salvageable, while the other throws thousands into uncertainty and erasure. As an Innovator and technician, she is torn between cautious reform and radical change, especially after a tense, late-night conversation with Alex the bartender about control, memory, and freedom.",
  "choice_a": "Deploys the 'Transparency Patch,' sharing BCI algorithms and Council meetings publicly, but only in edited, Council-approved form.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Partial truth is better than none for regaining public trust.",
    "Orderly openness buys time for deeper fixes.",
    "Keeping my hands clean means some hope for reform."

  "choice_b": "Initiates the erasure protocol, deleting thousands of BCI profiles to remove corrupted influence, even knowing it strands people outside the system.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Destroying the control grid is the only way to break old chains.",
    "Better to force self-reliance than preserve fake order.",
    "Sometimes you erase so people can finally start over."
