  "title": "The Truth Cascade",
  "story_summary": "In the engineered calm of Stenograd, Marek Halden's Behavioral Compliance Index silently shaped every life, its automated web adjusting citizens' fates with mathematical indifference - until Halden was found mysteriously dead, unraveling the illusion of perfect order. The Directorate, desperate to contain chaos and secrets, purged all traces of his code, resetting the city's systems and plunging residents into confusion as rights shifted overnight and anger spread. Trust in the Council dissolved further when Nikola Petrak, pressured yet cunning, leaked confidential reports exposing the Council's lies about Halden's death and deliberate system sabotage. Outraged, citizen-journalists pieced together the truth, igniting mass protests and toppling the Council's authority. As crowds flooded the streets and spontaneous assemblies formed, Stenograd's people seized the fragile moment to debate their own future, determined to claim true oversight and ensure no system - however efficient - could rule without their voice.",
