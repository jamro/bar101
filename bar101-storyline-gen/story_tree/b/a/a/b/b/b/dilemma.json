  "dilemma": "Choose to leak either the Council\u2019s secret reports, confirming high-level deception and causing a public reckoning, or release Halden\u2019s spiral blueprints, inspiring a new model for citizen assembly and governance. Both choices will set the city on a distinctly different path.",
  "reason": "Lenart is unsure because both options will reshape the city dramatically: exposing the truth could unleash chaos and anger, while offering a hopeful framework risks letting the Council escape consequences. His maintenance access makes him the only one able to act without immediate detection.",

    "A future must be built, not just burned down.",
    "Giving people a new way forward is kinder than giving just the painful truth.",
    "If hope is seeded wisely, the city can reinvent itself instead of fracturing completely."
