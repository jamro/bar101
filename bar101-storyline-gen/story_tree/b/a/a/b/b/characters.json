    "chapter": "After the Innovators\u2019 public proposal for amnesty and mediated hearings, Oksana arrived at work to find her team split between cautious optimism and silent suspicion. Several erased citizens, suddenly appearing on restored rosters, requested reactivation of their service profiles. Oksana was directed to review their appeals, but the Directorate\u2019s refusal to support amnesty created procedural ambiguities, leaving her with no clear precedent on approvals. She spent the day reviewing incomplete records while double-checking her own authorization for each action. At lunchtime, security officers entered the office to question staff about recent reinstatements. Colleagues who had previously kept their distance from Oksana now openly documented each of her interactions, further isolating her. She avoided internal messaging, fearing missteps. That evening, her BCI log showed heightened scrutiny due to her profile activity linked to reinstated citizens. Her score decreased by 4 points, reflecting increased system distrust and ongoing association with flagged individuals.",

    "chapter": "On May 18, Nikola used his secure access channels to transmit the verified personal records and testimonies of the erased citizens to the vanished network. He then coordinated with them to ensure the broadcast was timed for maximum visibility, personally confirming the integrity of each file before authorization. As the testimonies went live, Nikola avoided contact with neighbors and monitored the official response from his residence, observing increases in street gatherings and visible unrest. Service denials against previously erased residents abruptly ended as lower-level BCI administrators defected in response to the broadcast. Nikola\u2019s personal risk classification escalated almost immediately, with his monitoring profile reflagged and his automated service access suspended. His BCI score dropped significantly as a result, reflecting system penalties for aiding noncompliant citizens and facilitating unauthorized data transmission. His decision directly amplified mass unrest and accelerated shifts within the city\u2019s administrative ranks. His BCI score decreased from 54 to 34.",

    "chapter": "After the announcement of amnesty proposals for erased citizens and the resulting escalation of internal Council conflict, Daria\u2019s workday shifted dramatically. That morning, she was instructed to pause all routine identity verification on health band replacements while the system awaited new policy guidelines. As crowds swelled outside her service hub, Daria processed urgent requests for erased citizens using incomplete or contradictory data, aware she was being observed by both resistance sympathizers and system loyalists. At midday, she received a notification of a provisional freeze on individual audit logs, making it unclear if her actions would affect her score. For the first time, Daria hesitated to assist a trusted colleague concerned about a low score, choosing strict protocol instead of risk. By the end of her shift, the unresolved council split left her uncertain about tomorrow\u2019s rules, and her BCI score dropped again as flagged interactions accumulated. New BCI score: 55.",

    "chapter": "Following the citywide release of erased citizens\u2019 stories and the Innovators\u2019 proposal for mediated amnesty, Lenart noticed a shift in his daily jobs. On the morning of May 23, he was able to retrieve previous service logs that had recently reappeared in the system. He received an influx of repair requests from individuals whose profiles had once been blank, now appearing with provisional access statuses. While working in an apartment block, Lenart encountered neighbors openly discussing their erasure and participating in group calls for collective maintenance, an unusual level of transparency. Feeling the environment was less hostile, he accepted more jobs, using digital records instead of paper logs for the first time in weeks. However, he remained cautious, avoiding involvement in any public statements or protests. The increased openness and gradual reintegration of vanished individuals allowed him to work with less fear, causing a modest rise in his BCI score to 36.",

    "chapter": "On May 22, after Council Innovators proposed amnesty and mediated hearings for erased citizens, Sven Halek noticed an exceptional rise in unsanctioned discussions among staff in messaging corridors. The following week, Directorate refusal led to a Council deadlock, and Sven arrived to find his workgroup divided\u2014junior colleagues avoided responsibilities linked to the amnesty, some citing security fears. That day, Sven was denied access to personnel update feeds and found two of his most reliable team members had been reassigned without notice. During a scheduled policy session, disruptions in BCI clearance meant only delegates with the highest security ratings could participate, excluding Sven from critical messaging alignment. Forced to produce drafts without complete information, Sven restricted his own queries to minimize attention from monitoring tools. By end of day, he recorded all missed communication points, concluding that Council breakdown had sharply reduced workgroup cohesion. His BCI score decreased to 38 due to operational instability.",

    "chapter": "After the sudden citywide labor reshuffling placed previously erased citizens in key positions, Rada arrived at work to find the editorial queue supervised by a colleague she had never seen before, who carried no visible badge. The hallway outside was crowded with residents demanding explanations for denied services. Video monitors inside displayed official statements contradicting the confusion in the building. When Rada attempted to log a report, the system required additional biometric authentication, flagging her session for review. Coworkers began whispering openly about badge discrepancies and the reliability of their scores. Rada limited her workstation use to avoid attention and updated her offline archive with recordings of staff arguments. She kept her replies brief when questioned by supervisors, avoiding discussions of ongoing protests. Mandatory documentation of every activity slowed workflows. By evening, Rada\u2019s BCI score dropped as monitoring flagged her non-participation and incomplete logs. Current BCI score: 18.",
