  "content": "In 2025, Stenograd is ruled by the silent force of the Behavioral Compliance Index, an all-seeing system that quietly shapes every life; its architect, Marek Halden, is found dead, and the city\u2019s automated governance begins to falter. When Nikola Petrak bravely unlocks files proving the BCI\u2019s secret erasures, erased citizens\u2014lost to the system but not to memory\u2014seize the broadcast channels, sharing raw stories that spark citywide outrage and mass protests. As public sympathy surges, fractured administrators and Innovators push for amnesty and open hearings, but the Directorate resists, deepening chaos and paralyzing the city\u2019s algorithms. In a desperate bid for order, the Council\u2014nudged by the Innovators and a rogue executive\u2014launches restoration tribunals where erased citizens recount injustices and the system\u2019s keepers stage careful confessions. Temporary calm returns as some scores are restored and apologies offered, but the polished reconciliations raise suspicion; behind closed doors, the true depth of the system\u2019s abuses\u2014and many fates\u2014remain hidden, stirring a quiet undercurrent of distrust beneath Stenograd\u2019s newly tranquil surface."
