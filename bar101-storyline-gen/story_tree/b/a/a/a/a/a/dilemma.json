  "dilemma": "Nikola Petrak must decide whether to authorize a citywide blackout as the Directorate urges, stopping all BCI oversight to safeguard what remains of the system, or to secretly help the disappeared citizens organize and reveal themselves, risking greater upheaval but offering a chance at true civic renewal.",
  "reason": "Nikola is torn between his Harmonist belief in gradual, orderly transition and his private doubts about the system, intensified by recent conversations with Alex, who pressed him to consider the human cost of silence and secrecy. He knows both options will permanently change Stenograd\u2019s direction, and fears the unintended consequences either way.",
  "choice_a": "Authorize the Directorate\u2019s blackout, pausing BCI oversight so the Council can regroup and citizens must self-organize without digital scoring.",
  "belief_a": [
    "Order must be restored before any real reform can happen.",
    "Change must be managed slowly, with minimal risk.",

  "choice_b": "Quietly supply the \u2018vanished\u2019 with evidence and protocols, allowing them to reveal themselves and build non-score zones, even if it dismantles trust in algorithmic governance.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Truth must come before order, even if it is painful.",
    "The people have a right to reclaim their own civic destiny.",
    "Old systems built on secrecy must be openly challenged to heal."
