The Directorate called me in\u2014stripped away any illusion of infallibility from my drafts, pulled colleagues for reviews. A few disappeared. I worked alone, no access to my own archives. The BCI nipped me too, called it 'information withholding.' You wonder who\u2019s actually controlling this anymore. Everything feels strange now, as if the city is holding its breath."

One day I\u2019m writing scripts for order, the next\u2014dragged before security, told to erase the system\u2019s perfection from every phrase. My Directorate ties mean nothing when no one trusts each other. Colleagues\u2014old hands, loyal\u2014swept into silence. All signals point to fracture. My own BCI dipped; now I watch myself at work and at home. I\u2019ve spent years dressing power in certainties and now\u2014they want uncertainty to be the new truth.
