  "trigger_event": "With the city in chaos after the BCI\u2019s collapse, Rada receives exclusive access to two powerful tools: Halden\u2019s secret Echo Protocol that can quietly guide the city toward self-organization, and a confessional video from Halden revealing his regrets and calling for public reckoning.",
  "dilemma": "Rada must choose to broadcast either the Echo Protocol\u2014guiding citizens toward new, cooperative order\u2014or Halden\u2019s confessional video, sparking open reckoning and honest debate. She cannot choose both, as releasing both would plunge the city into paralyzing confusion.",
  "reason": "Both choices could redefine Stenograd\u2019s future, but each risks alienating factions and letting chaos spiral if mishandled. Rada\u2019s journalist instincts pull her toward public truth, but Alex\u2019s reflective advice on human nature makes her consider practical action for the city\u2019s stability.",
  "choice_a": "Broadcast the Echo Protocol, giving the city a subtle blueprint for self-organization, and withholding Halden\u2019s confession.",
  "belief_a": [
    "People organize best when given just enough direction, not overwhelmed by confession.",
    "A system, even a loose one, is better than emotional turmoil in a crisis.",
    "Public catharsis can wait; daily life must go on first."
  ],
  "choice_b": "Broadcast Halden\u2019s emotional video confession, igniting public discussion and calls for shared healing, and withhold the protocol.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Honest reckoning comes before rebuilding any order.",
    "People need to see the truth laid bare\u2014even if painful.",
    "Systems can be rebuilt, but trust can\u2019t if the truth stays hidden."
