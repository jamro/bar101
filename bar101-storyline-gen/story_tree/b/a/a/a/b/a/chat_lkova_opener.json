      "Colder? Sure. People glare, doors stick. I fix what breaks, but I mostly wander tunnels for kicks. My hobby, really. Urban exploring. Echoes in the BCI woke up a lot of old locks\u2014places I liked are harder to reach, even for me."

      "Definitely colder. Even the steel underfoot feels nervous these days. I hunt old city infrastructure when I\u2019m off the clock. Data center doors, sealed tramways, power tunnels\u2014my playground, normally. BCI glitches have botched all the routes lately. Got boxed in by a forgotten penalty last week\u2014couldn\u2019t get back through my favorite hatch."

      "Feels colder up top and below ground. City\u2019s got memory now, can\u2019t escape it. I\u2019m Lenart\u2014urban explorer since before the BCI tracked our shadows. Tunnels, forgotten nodes, old server caves. Usually I slip through fine. With these BCI echoes, even obsolete infra shoves my history in my face. Last Friday, I got trapped in a substation corridor thanks to an ancient breach notice. Never happened before the system rewound itself. Makes the old hobby feel like trespassing, though it\u2019s just habit."
