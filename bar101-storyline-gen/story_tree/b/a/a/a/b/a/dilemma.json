  "dilemma": "Should Nikola unlock and release the poetic message Halden left\u2014guiding citizens toward peaceful unity and symbolic resistance\u2014or should he expose the full, raw archive of historic BCI abuses, unleashing painful truths and opening the door to direct public reckoning?",
  "reason": "Nikola is torn between wanting to preserve hard-won stability with a humane gesture and facing the risk that only honesty and public exposure will lead to real renewal.
