  "content": "In the gleaming but tightly controlled city of Stenograd, where every citizen\u2019s life is shaped by the all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index, chaos erupts after the system\u2019s architect, Marek Halden, is found dead and vital controls begin to slip. Oksana Lintz, caught between fear and responsibility, secretly triggers Halden\u2019s failsafe: the Mosaic Reversion, restoring all BCI scores to their volatile 2022 state. Overnight, former outcasts become elite, trusted figures are lost in the shuffle, and the city\u2019s careful order collapses into confusion and bitter power struggles. As council factions fight to regain control, Oksana balances desperate demands to explain or suppress the truth, while impromptu assemblies gather beneath the city\u2019s iconic mural, turning public outrage into debate and igniting calls for real reform as Stenograd\u2019s future hangs in the balance."
