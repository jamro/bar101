  "outcome": "In response to ongoing chaos, a failsafe protocol designed by Halden\u2014known as 'Mosaic Reversion'\u2014triggers, reverting all BCI scores to 2022 levels for three weeks. Old privileges resurface as former outcasts gain status and recognized leaders become \u2018unknowns\u2019 again. Panic replaces order, the mural\u2019s symbolism shifting as people scramble for lost positions. Oksana Lintz, aware of the protocol\u2019s origins, faces a choice: explain, contain, or exploit the reset as all factions scramble to gain new ground.",
