Now, with all this transparency, my skills aren't just useless\u2014they almost feel exposed. My score is stuck at 58\u2014right where I can't move or disappear.

People publicly debated their BCI histories in the lab before the Council turned everything off. I used to help folks clean their records, because I never trusted the scoring\u2014my little brother vanished in a BCI audit. My score\u2019s stuck at 58, not low enough to get flagged, not high enough to be trusted. Honestly, I preferred the Innovators\u2019 idea of fixing the system, not pausing it.
