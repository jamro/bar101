  "dilemma": "Lenart must choose between triggering a blackout to reveal a hidden mural\u2014a physical symbol likely to rally and unite citizens in open defiance\u2014or quietly activating a puzzle app update that will scatter clues across the city and spark widespread, decentralized resistance.",
  "reason": "Lenart knows whichever path he chooses will shape the city\u2019s future resistance: a single, potent symbol could channel unrest but become a clear Directorate target, while scattered clues would empower hidden networks but risk uncontrollable chaos. Alex\u2019s advice echoes in his mind, highlighting the stakes of public unity versus personal agency.",
