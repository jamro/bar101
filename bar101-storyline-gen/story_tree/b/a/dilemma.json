  "trigger_event": "Summoned after hours to a failing network relay, Lenart finds both a mysterious failsafe that could pause BCI citywide and rival Council patches ready to fragment control. After a wry, sobering conversation with Alex, he faces a momentous choice: open the floodgates for everyone, or let factions carve up the city.",
  "dilemma": "Lenart must choose whether to activate the failsafe, shutting down the BCI for everyone and forcing the city into a moment of raw human trust, or allow rival Council patches to take over, creating fractured zones with different levels of control and freedom.",
  "reason": "Lenart knows either choice will change Stenograd forever. He worries that a citywide shutdown could spark both hope and chaos, while allowing patchwork control might cement divisions, but at least let local communities improvise. He is torn between the desire for collective reset and respect for hard local resilience.",
  "choice_a": "Trigger the failsafe, initiating a citywide pause of the BCI and letting organic social order emerge unexpectedly.",
  "belief_a": [
    "True trust is only tested in freedom, not surveillance.",
    "Sometimes the system needs to step back so people can see each other again.",
    "A collective reset could rekindle solidarity before division becomes permanent."
  ],
  "choice_b": "Let rival Council patches run, allowing neighborhoods to evolve fragmented control schemes, risking confusion but enabling local rule.",
  "belief_b": [
    "Let communities prove themselves by necessity, not idealism.",
    "Order\u2014however patched together\u2014is better than anarchy from above.",
    "It\u2019s wiser to trust what can be managed in person than abstract resets."
