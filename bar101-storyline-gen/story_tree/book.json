When Halden mysteriously dies alone in his sealed residence, the city falters; crucial systems stutter, scores and privileges begin to misfire, and no one holds true authority to fix the unraveling order. Halden\u2019s devotion to cold, neutral efficiency leaves Stenograd suddenly exposed\u2014a city built on algorithms now paralyzed by the loss of its silent architect."
