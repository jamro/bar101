  "title": "The Forgotten Ghosts Return",
  "story_summary": "In the hyper-regulated city of Stenograd, where daily life is quietly shaped by the all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index, order begins to unravel after its creator, Marek Halden, is found dead and critical systems falter. Amid the growing uncertainty, Oksana Lintz, once loyal to the machinery of governance, bravely unleashes secret archives revealing years of BCI abuses and the forced disappearances of residents. Outrage spreads like wildfire when loved ones, long vanished, suddenly return and demand justice, refusing to stay silent. The city erupts in protest as survivors share harrowing stories of wrongful scoring and hidden detentions, shattering trust in the ruling Council. Pressed by public fury and their own disarray, Council members promise an inquiry, but internal conflict only deepens the crisis, leaving Stenograd suspended between long-awaited truth and an uncertain future.",
