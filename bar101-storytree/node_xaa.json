You know, I got into paper folding\u2014real origami\u2014back in university, when long commutes meant I\u2019d kill time with office drafts. It was a way to structure chaos. Now? I fold intricate tessellations and animals from rejected BCI printouts, even outage logs. Last Friday, I caught myself freezing because the printout had a half-redacted citizen ID. With all those surprise detentions after the update, I spent an hour just sorting my origami paper into \u2018safe\u2019 and \u2018questionable\u2019 stacks.

The best paper for structure is old Directorate briefings\u2014thinner, crisp\u2014but after Marek\u2019s death and this identity chaos, I felt real dread about which files I could use. Last week I scrapped three models halfway through because the source docs looked too new. Making a swan out of a flagged report now feels like holding someone else\u2019s fingerprint.",

Each time I try to finish one, I\u2019m rehearsing what I\u2019d say if someone from Security ever asked where the paper came from.
