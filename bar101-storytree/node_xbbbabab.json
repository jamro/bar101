  "title": "Council's Last Stand",
  "story_summary": "In 2025, Stenograd's people quietly lived under the watchful eye of the Behavioral Compliance Index, an invisible system that rewarded obedience and quietly punished dissent, all orchestrated by its enigmatic architect, Marek Halden. When Halden was found dead in his locked apartment and the system began to falter, fear gripped the city's rulers. The powerful Directorate pushed propaganda, urging calm and hiding the system's failures, while Nikola Petrak publicly called for unity and released carefully chosen stories. But the citizens saw through these efforts, flooding the streets with silent protests and reading Halden's final warnings in city squares, letting tales of past abuses ripple through the crowds. As peaceful demonstrations swelled, pressure mounted until the Council and Directorate stepped down, dissolving the old order and allowing citizens' assemblies to guide Stenograd into a new, self-governed era.",
