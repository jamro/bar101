  "story_summary": "In Stenograd, where a silent, all-seeing system scores every citizen and shapes daily life, chaos erupts after the mysterious death of Marek Halden, the architect of the city's Behavioral Compliance Index. As automated governance falters, power-hungry councils covertly weaponize Halden's secret override protocols, sabotaging rival BCI systems to gain advantage. Essential services unravel, triggering widespread mistrust and angry street protests. Sensing disaster, Oksana Lintz and Nikola Petrak unite feuding leaders, forging a tense truce that halts sabotage and restores order, giving hope that cooperation might save their fractured city.",
