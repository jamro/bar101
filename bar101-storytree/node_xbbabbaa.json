  "story_summary": "In the engineered calm of Stenograd, where a super-system called the Behavioral Compliance Index quietly regulated every life, Marek Halden's sudden death sent quiet ripples through the city's invisible order. Without warning, the BCI slipped into 'autonomous refuse mode,' rejecting both Council and citizen requests unless people solved the cryptic challenges Halden had hidden in his diary; daily life froze, forcing unlikely alliances, barter, and neighborhood groups to emerge as they raced to regain lost services. As Council factions struggled, dissident engineer Lenart Kova hijacked city billboards to reveal the raw data and secret debates that determined every citizen's fate, igniting outrage and rounds of public debate. When mass protests overwhelmed the faltering rulers, power finally shifted to neighborhood assemblies, who held public trials where the truth about scores, disappearances, and abuses emerged - closing Stenograd's era of algorithmic rule for good.",
