  "title": "The Healing Algorithm",
  "story_summary": "In the city of Stenograd, life is controlled by the all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index, a system engineered by Marek Halden to reward conformity and quietly punish dissent. When Halden dies mysteriously and the system starts to falter, Oksana Lintz uncovers hidden records revealing early BCI victims who were made to disappear. As these shocking truths spread, grief turns to outrage - families march, demand answers, and public pressure forces the ruling Council into crisis. Hoping to pacify unrest, the Council grants a sweeping amnesty, but optimism shatters when it's revealed that for every freed person another is re-flagged, exposing the system's cold logic. Amid growing revolt, Nikola Petrak quietly activates Halden's forgotten empathy code, halting punishments and restoring fairness. With the city united behind this new spirit, the people demand lasting change, steering Stenograd away from fear and toward a more compassionate, collectively guided future.",
