  "title": "The Ledger of Ghosts",
  "story_summary": "In the heart of Stenograd, where daily life is quietly steered by the towering Behavioral Compliance Index, the city falters after its architect, Marek Halden, is found dead and the system begins to fail. As essential services collapse, Directorate loyalists sabotage infrastructure and seek to blame chaos on the BCI's demise, but behind closed doors, officials like Lenart Kova move to hide the truth - until tech activists and repair crews rally communities, exposing the deception and igniting a groundswell for local justice and shared governance. Tensions erupt when Rada Miskovic uncovers a hidden ledger revealing countless citizens erased by the BCI, fueling public outrage and citywide protests as grieving families demand answers. With trust in the Council shattered, investigators trace the disappearances to unauthorized actions by both Halden and the highest officials, pushing leadership to finally confess and promise a memorial for the vanished. Yet as a broken city grapples with its wounds, the people's call for real democracy rises louder than ever, signaling the end of silent, algorithmic rule.",
