  "title": "Trial by Algorithm",
  "story_summary": "In the city of Stenograd, where the algorithmic Behavioral Compliance Index quietly ruled every life, journalist Rada Miskovic uncovered a web of injustice beneath the system's sleek facade. After Marek Halden, the BCI's elusive creator, died mysteriously, Rada rejected the Council's calls for order and courageously exposed evidence of score manipulation and disappearances on live broadcast, urging victims and whistleblowers to speak out. As the city erupted in testimony, even high-ranking officials admitted their failures, and Halden's final secret message - urging transparency - broadcast during a tense public trial, pushed Stenograd into open debate. Outraged citizens forced a referendum, dismantling centralized BCI control and Council power, and as neighborhoods reclaimed authority, Rada captured the dawn of a freer Stenograd born from the truth Halden sacrificed himself to reveal.",
