  "title": "The Day of the Ghosts",
  "story_summary": "In the tightly controlled city of Stenograd, where life was shaped by a relentless behavioral scoring system, Daria Tomenko couldn't forget the pain of her brother's disappearance or the silence that followed. Driven by guilt and hope, she triggered a hidden protocol to restore all those erased by the system, flooding the city with lost faces and reuniting broken families. The shock rippled through Stenograd, as returned residents - once invisible - stood up to demand justice and an end to the BCI's rule. Grassroots gatherings swelled, emotional testimonies echoed through district assemblies, and mounting public pressure forced the ruling Council to suspend the BCI. As the city faced its haunted past through truth hearings, new hopes for justice and belonging began to take root where control once reigned.",
