              "I heard from old contacts that Nikola and the Secretariat practically begged the military to step in after last week's tribunal chaos. Officially, it's about 'stability' - really, everyone's covering their own failures.",
              "Ration lines and pass checks started overnight, and it's nastier this time if your score's bad. Used to be, you'd get a warning. Now they just block you out.",
              "Ghost citizens are back in play - people the system lost, or erased. Some are using that to build shadow networks, showing up where the Council isn't looking.",
              "False BCI updates are rippling through the city. Some are intentionally letting 'invisibles' in, others just want to mess up the checkpoints.",
              "Council factions are tearing into each other - Directorate barking about security, Innovators demanding tech fixes, Harmonists just want calm, but nobody's calm now.",

              "I don't buy the propaganda line. Never have - my loyalty's to the stories other people want to bury. Lately, that's more dangerous than ever."
