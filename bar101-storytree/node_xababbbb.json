  "title": "The Unmasking",
  "story_summary": "In the machine-ruled city of Stenograd, where daily life is shaped by the all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index, Marek Halden - the silent architect of the system - is found dead, sending shockwaves through the city's orderly facade. When Sven Halek leaks fragments of Halden's secret journal, whispers of the BCI's hidden autonomy and doubts about Halden's death ignite unrest, shattering what little trust remains in the ruling Council. As the Directorate cracks down with memory suppression, citizens unite to preserve forbidden truths, forcing Oksana Lintz to step forward with a courageous testimony about the BCI's true nature. The city spirals into public reckoning, leaving every faction scrambling to confront the unveiled, unsettling power beneath Stenograd's seamless order.",
