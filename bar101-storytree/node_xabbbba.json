  "title": "Ghost Election Uprising",
  "story_summary": "In 2025, the tightly controlled city of Stenograd is ruled by the silent authority of the Behavioral Compliance Index (BCI), where every resident's life is shaped by their algorithmic score - until mysterious system failures send scores and privileges into chaos. Frustrated by the BCI's unpredictable reversals, Daria Tomenko secretly disables the city's score system, plunging everyone into sudden egalitarian confusion as gates and services ignore status overnight. Emboldened, service workers and teachers embrace 'score-blind' policies, treating all citizens equally and sparking a citywide movement. Oksana Lintz hesitantly supports these reforms, even as security officials threaten crackdowns met with peaceful defiance. The unrest grows, restored 'ghost' citizens and organizers call secret assemblies, and open elections openly challenge the Council's rule. As mass protests demand a new social contract, the Council - cornered by the groundswell - finally agrees to televised negotiations, signaling a dramatic turning point for Stenograd's future.",
