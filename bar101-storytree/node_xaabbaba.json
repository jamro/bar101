  "title": "The Living Archive",
  "story_summary": "In the heart of Stenograd, a city governed by silent algorithms and the all-powerful Behavioral Compliance Index, the sudden death of system architect Marek Halden sets the city on edge. Oksana Lintz, risking everything, releases evidence of BCI abuses and records of citizens who had vanished without warning, sparking outrage as families discover the truth behind their losses. Survivors reappear, demanding justice, and the Council's authority crumbles under waves of protest and scandal. Driven by the public's fury, Nikola Petrak unlocks Halden's hidden archives, unveiling irrefutable proof of widespread score manipulation and forced disappearances orchestrated by those in power. As the truth spreads, citizens convene public tribunals, Council members resign in shame, and for the first time in Stenograd's history, control passes into the hands of the people, closing an era of unseen rule and sparking hope for genuine justice.",
