  "title": "The Halden Testament",
  "story_summary": "In 2025, Stenograd is ruled not by politicians, but by the all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index (BCI), a system built by Marek Halden to quietly shape every life through invisible scores. When Halden dies mysteriously and systems falter, Nikola Petrak, moved by calls for justice, unleashes a powerful override that lets local councils rewrite the BCI's rules. In the free zones, old penalties are erased and dissent rewarded, as neighborhoods clash over fairness and the true meaning of justice. Everything changes when Halden's secret confession broadcasts citywide - he admits the BCI's harms, apologizes, and urges its end. Emotions boil over; survivors and officials alike share stories of regret, and the city faces a wrenching vote: erase the BCI forever or attempt one final reform. When results reveal a city divided, Stenograd stands at a crossroads, forced at last to confront the meaning of control, freedom, and healing.",
