  "title": "Testimony War",
  "story_summary": "In the shadowed heart of Stenograd, where the city's fate is quietly mapped by the Behavioral Compliance Index, sudden turmoil takes hold after a sweeping amnesty returns erased 'ghosts' to public life. As their haunting testimonies flood the airwaves, stories of lost identities and systematic abuses ignite fierce debates, while the powerful Directorate responds with fear-laced propaganda, deepening rifts in the neighborhoods. Violence erupts and anxiety simmers, driving two unlikely mediators, Lintz and Kova, to the forefront, urging peace. The city is thrown into deeper uncertainty when secret files leak, revealing that Halden - the BCI's creator and last steady hand - had quietly tried to save many from erasure, reframing him as a tragic, flawed savior and throwing Stenograd's faith in its own system into question.",
