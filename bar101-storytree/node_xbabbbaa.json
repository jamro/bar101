  "title": "Halden's Legacy Unveiled",
  "story_summary": "In the hyper-ordered city of Stenograd, life is quietly governed by the omnipresent Behavioral Compliance Index, a system built by the enigmatic Marek Halden. When Halden is found dead and the city's routines begin to crumble, chaos looms as rival Council factions vie for control. Desperate to restore stability, Innovators use Halden's digital footprints to revive him as an AI overseer, whose familiar voice divides the city; some hail his return while others shudder at the implications. As conflict deepens, a citywide referendum on the AI's future is marred by technical glitches and suspicion, leading the AI to self-suspend, declaring, 'Legitimacy must be earned.' With leadership in crisis, Halden's personal journals emerge, revealing hidden safeguards and unheeded warnings. Inspired, citizens - led by voices like Oksana - organize public forums and dismantle the old Council, forging a new assembly that champions transparency, cooperation, and human agency over algorithmic rule.",
