  "title": "The Spiral Reckoning",
  "story_summary": "In the city of Stenograd, where daily life revolves around a powerful algorithmic system called the Behavioral Compliance Index (BCI), Marek Halden's sudden death throws the rigid order into chaos. When Nikola Petrak releases Halden's spiral override - granting local councils the power to rewrite BCI scoring rules - whole neighborhoods reshape the meaning of fairness overnight. Some celebrate vanished penalties and justice for past dissenters, while others fear new abuses. As people's lives are upended by shifting access to work, housing, and healthcare, fierce citywide debates erupt over whether to abolish the BCI or defend its local reinventions. Behind closed doors, leaders like Oksana Lintz and Petrak wrestle with their creation's power to heal and divide, even as Stenograd's future hangs uncertain, caught between newfound autonomy and the risk of deepening conflict.",

              "The free zones... they're not just experiments. They're already showing people can self-govern, at least while the chaos lasts.",
