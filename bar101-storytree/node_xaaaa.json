  "title": "The Halden Effect",
  "story_summary": "In Stenograd, a city where daily life is quietly shaped by a powerful algorithm called the Behavioral Compliance Index (BCI), Marek Halden stands at the center, a silent engineer whose vision made the system run. With every move and transaction monitored, the city runs smoothly until the morning Halden is found dead, alone in his sealed office, leaving behind a maze of access codes only he could navigate. Suddenly, services stall, scores act erratically, and trust starts to fracture. When a devastating data leak exposes the private scores and secrets of citizens and officials, outrage sweeps the streets, while the Council - split between those who want stability, innovation, or hard control - turn on each other, desperate to regain order. Blame quickly falls on Oksana Lintz, Halden's key technician, but leaked reports reveal the cracks began before her. As neighborhoods are torn apart by wild swings in privilege and punishment, chaos spreads - until forgotten corners of the city once touched by Halden become rare refuges of spontaneous freedom, offering hope and rebellion as the old system stumbles and new possibilities flicker to life.",
