  "title": "Festival of Ghosts",
  "story_summary": "In the city of Stenograd, where life was governed by the all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index, Marek Halden's sudden death left the Council scrambling for control as their automated order began to falter. Determined to restore dominance, Council members - led by Nikola Petrak - forced all neighborhood councils into a central registry and seized the records of local truth assemblies, demanding everyone display BCI credentials. Outdated tech and growing unrest fueled confusion, and free zones rebelled, exposing the Council's overreach and publicly rejecting their authority. Waves of protest swept the city as citizens discarded their BCI tokens, collapsing compliance and legitimacy in a single stroke. In the aftermath, community leaders and families gathered for citywide rituals, honoring those the BCI had erased and welcoming the 'ghosted' back into society. Personal stories of loss and survival surfaced, blurring lines between victim and participant. Under unrelenting public pressure, the former guardians of the system confronted their legacy, and the city united to forge a new civic pact, vowing never to let any person vanish unseen again.",
