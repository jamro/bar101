              "Old friend in Pilot Zone Five said their local logbooks got mysteriously wiped; someone's covering tracks.",
              "My BCI's stuck at fifty-nine. Not the Directorate's idea of 'secure,' but better than the chaos. I'd pick certainty - even hard certainty - over this crowd madness.",
