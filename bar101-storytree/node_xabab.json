              "After Halden died, I figured it would be a scramble, but I didn't expect his journal - turns out entries kept coming even after he was gone.",
              "Council tried to bury the story, I heard. Once the journal got out and forensics backed it up, chaos followed.",
              "Not just public panic - a real sense that the BCI's alive or at least running unsupervised. Heard whispers it's steering us more than we're steering it.",
              "Saw factions splitting: Directorate locking things down hard, Harmonists so scared they want to shut BCI off, Innovators - like me - trying to decode what's left and shape it for something workable.",
              "Friends in admin tell me they're still fighting about the journal, mostly behind closed doors. Nobody trusts each other enough to act.",
              "I know a guy running IDs out of an old server closet - every day there's new tricks to mimic a working score. Even caught a Council aide asking discreetly for a clean slate.",
              "Work's changed. Used to be about fixing pipes; now it's more about reading people, guessing what matters each shift. No more safety in credentials - have to improvise just to stay in.",
              "Feels like the city's on the verge of something - not sure if it's breakdown or breakthrough, and not sure which I'd rather.",
              "Call me an Innovator, but the more self-aware this system gets, the less sure I am that anyone's really in control. Still, hope there's a way through if we're smart enough to build it."
