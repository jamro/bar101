  "title": "Trial Without Judge",
  "story_summary": "In 2025, Stenograd is ruled by the silent force of the Behavioral Compliance Index - a citywide system that quietly shapes every life. When its architect, Marek Halden, is found dead and the system unravels, chaos erupts as citizens suddenly roam free from algorithmic control. At first, confusion reigns, but in the absence of the BCI, neighborhoods come alive with spontaneous assemblies and mutual aid, replacing digital scores with handmade tokens of trust. As two weeks pass, hope and distrust collide: some long for the order of the old system, while others see a chance for justice. Former Council members are summoned to face their accusers, and dark secrets emerge, especially when a once-erased dissident - the so-called 'ghost' - returns to share the real story behind disappearances and bias. As the city debates its future, split between restoring centralized power and embracing newfound community-led justice, Stenograd finds itself at a crossroads, forever changed by the taste of both uncertainty and freedom.",
