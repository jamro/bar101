              "It feels like the entire order we believed in just dissolved when the blackout exposed that mural. Halden - like he was never really part of this system.",
              "Assemblies started almost overnight. People who were invisible before are setting new rules.",
              "Services, housing - even food, it's all negotiated in little groups now. I never saw so much improvisation.",
              "The Council's fighting on every call. Directorate officers just make threats. No real control left.",
              "I saw the original Mosaic Reversion protocol, years old - Halden's final failsafe. I triggered it trying to reset things, not... break them.",
              "Harmonism meant stability through predictable systems. But after all this, I'm not sure anyone really believes it anymore.",
              "Half the city debates ditching the BCI. The Innovators want to update it, the Directorate just threatens more.",
              "I'm flagged now - so low in the system I might as well be erased. It's strange to still hope people find a new way.",
              "Maybe the mural is the real system now - only place people trust what they see."
