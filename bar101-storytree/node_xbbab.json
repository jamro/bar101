              "BCI scrambled everything. You had doctors sweeping floors, engineers pouring coffee, actual hazard. Whole blocks stalled out and no one in charge knew what to say.",
              "Disappeared folks reappeared - scattered, haunted. All they remember is a kind of silence, long and blank. Could've been holding cells. I've known some of them for years.",
              "Analog flyers everywhere. Handwritten lists of who vanished. People knocking on doors, organizing silent search lines at night.",
              "I patched a transmitter for a neighborhood group - they were running off old recordings of Halden and a Harmonist. Cross-referencing them with Council schedules, would you believe.",
              "The diary on those screens is too accurate, predicts supply shutoffs, which streets will lock down. Makes you wonder if Halden wanted us to see how broken it'd become after he was gone.",
              "Directorate went full blunt force - shut all the networks. Drove the resistance into whispers and paper instead of stopping it.",
              "Harmonists seeing their worst fears. The system's supposed to rebalance itself quietly. Now it looks almost vengeful.",
              "I've lost gigs, sure, but it's the look in people's eyes that cuts. No one feels safe, no one trusts any number on the BCI.",
              "Best I can do is keep patching what I can and hope something steadies before the Council's civil war spills out on the streets."
