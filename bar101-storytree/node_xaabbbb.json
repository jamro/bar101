  "title": "Public Justice Hearings",
  "story_summary": "In the surveillance-drenched city of Stenograd, where algorithms rule and the Behavioral Compliance Index shapes every life, Rada Miskovic - a principled insider - rejects the Council's secret plan to recalibrate the system after its architect, Marek Halden, dies mysteriously. Defying the authorities, she leaks damning evidence of abuses and urges citizens to form grassroots juries, igniting a wave of public reckonings. Livestreamed hearings thrust former officials into the light, conflicting testimonies and fresh leaks fanning protests and outrage. As Council factions desperately release even older secrets to salvage their power, the city is swept up in both the thrill of long-denied justice and the turmoil of new divisions, forever changed by glimpses of the hidden machinery controlling their fate.",
