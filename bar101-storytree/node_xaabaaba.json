  "title": "Halden's Master Plan Revealed",
  "story_summary": "In the heart of Stenograd, where a powerful algorithm called the Behavioral Compliance Index quietly ruled every life, unrest simmered beneath the city's smooth, machine-driven order. When the system's elusive architect, Marek Halden, was found dead in his sealed home, the backbone of governance began to falter, sparking a swelling movement among those branded noncompliant. Empowered citizens boldly declared themselves 'scoreless,' abandoning BCI-controlled services to build vibrant parallel communities and self-governed districts, while authorities scrambled to crush the rebellion but only stoked further defiance - even as officials themselves began to defect. Amid this upheaval, reformers Oksana and Rada uncovered Halden's hidden truth: he had sabotaged his own system, exposing its flaws so Stenograd could reclaim its future. As his confession swept the city, residents rose to demand transparency, forcing the old Council to resign. Together, they dismantled the BCI, erased its ranks and scores, and replaced it all with open assemblies, forging a new era of collective, participatory rule born from one man's final, calculated sacrifice.",
