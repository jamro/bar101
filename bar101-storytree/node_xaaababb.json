  "title": "Judgment Day by Assembly",
  "story_summary": "In the tightly controlled capital of Stenograd, where everyday life is quietly shaped by the all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index, chaos erupts when Marek Halden - the system's elusive architect - is found dead in his fortress-like home. As the automated city falters and secrets surface, Oksana Lintz, a determined citizen, bravely chooses to hide Halden's sensitive files and calls for open justice. Neighborhood assemblies unite, organizing a public tribunal streamed across districts, where whistleblowers and residents reveal years of BCI abuses and silent erasures. With exposed Council and Directorate members confronting hard questions and Oksana admitting her own desperate actions, the city faces a reckoning. After days of gripping testimony, citizens collectively vote to dismantle the old Council, transform the surveillance infrastructure for democratic use, and embrace a future defined by open assemblies and shared governance, reclaiming their city's fate from the hands of faceless algorithms.",
