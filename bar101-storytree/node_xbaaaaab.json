  "title": "Echoes of the Vanished",
  "story_summary": "In the shadowed heart of Stenograd, where obedience is scored and life is quietly shaped by the all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index, a spark of defiance quietly catches fire. When Nikola Petrak - troubled by mounting abuses - secretly aids the city's vanished citizens, he sets in motion a wave of revelation that upends the city's tightly controlled order. As the Directorate scrambles to stop leaks and the Council fractures over how to respond, the vanished step boldly into the light, exposing erased identities and the possibility of freedom beyond surveillance. Inspired, ordinary residents form non-score zones, openly rejecting the city's algorithms, while uncertainty and hope sweep through Stenograd's streets. The Council, torn between force and reform, faces a crisis as public rallies demand a choice: continue with invisible, inhuman rule, or seize the chance to shape their own destiny.",
