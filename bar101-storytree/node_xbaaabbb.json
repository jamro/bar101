  "story_summary": "In the tense summer of 2025, Stenograd's elegant machinery stutters after the sudden death of Marek Halden, the architect behind its all-powerful Behavioral Compliance Index. Services collapse, leaving the city anxious until Lenart Kova, desperate for stability, secretly revives the system's dormant protocols to restore order. Relief gives way to suspicion as citizens notice old algorithmic nudges shaping their daily lives, and rumors swirl when Oksana Lintz uncovers remnants of Halden's mysterious final upgrades. As blame ricochets through Council factions and debate rages over the city's fate, thousands gather outside Council headquarters, demanding answers and reigniting the question: is Stenograd's destiny its own, or the secret will of the system Halden left behind?",
