  "title": "The Archive Verdict",
  "story_summary": "In the tightly controlled city of Stenograd, where the Behavioral Compliance Index quietly dictates every citizen's fate, Marek Halden - the engineer behind the system - dies mysteriously in his sealed home, shaking the city's seamless order. When Daria Tomenko, torn between loyalty and truth, covertly leaks explosive medical records and rigged audit files linking the Council to Halden's death and the ensuing coverup, outrage sweeps the city. Vigils and public debates erupt as the Council, divided by panicked infighting, bows to mounting pressure with limited confessions and promises of transparency, leaving Stenograd teetering between old loyalties and the yearning for accountability.",
