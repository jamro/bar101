  "title": "The Last Directive",
  "story_summary": "In the surveilled city of Stenograd, where life is shaped by the all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index, Marek Halden quietly governs through code, until his mysterious death shakes the city's foundations. When massive public renunciations of BCI tokens threaten the illusion of stability, Halden's hidden failsafe is triggered by the conflicted Sven Halek, flooding every citizen's feed with haunting records of how the system secretly altered their fates. Shock spreads as people discover lost loves, stolen opportunities, and friendships molded by algorithms. The city erupts in urgent assemblies, with former rivals and ordinary citizens confronting a painful past and demanding answers. As council factions scramble for control, the people seize the present - culminating in a citywide vote that decides whether to embrace radical transparency or bury the scars of the BCI era, forging a new, uncertain path for Stenograd.",
