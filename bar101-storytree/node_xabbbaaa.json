  "title": "Scoreless Society",
  "story_summary": "In the tightly controlled city of Stenograd, where citizens' lives are managed by the ever-present Behavioral Compliance Index, order seems unbreakable until its architect, Marek Halden, is found dead under mysterious circumstances. As the system falters, Lenart Kova and Oksana Lintz uncover Halden's hidden diagrams and code, risking everything to trigger a secret rollback that abruptly shifts privileges and brings erased 'ghost' citizens back into the light. These ghosts, once vanished by the system, seize their chance - demanding recognition and justice in exchange for helping to stabilize the crumbling city. Their return sparks bitter debates, exposes past abuses, and fractures the ruling Council, even as protests boil over. As Lintz and Kova call for a temporary score amnesty, citizens cautiously reclaim their voices, only to discover an unfixable flaw deep within the BCI. Guided by Halden's final clues, they disable scoring altogether, forcing Stenograd to rebuild itself beyond the shadows of algorithmic control.",
