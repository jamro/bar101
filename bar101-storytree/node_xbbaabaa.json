  "title": "The Confession Algorithm",
  "story_summary": "In the maze-like capital of Stenograd, Marek Halden's Behavioral Compliance Index rules daily life, silently rewarding or restricting citizens through invisible scores. After Halden's sudden, suspicious death, a disgruntled insider named Rada Miskovic leaks damning Council dossiers, exposing the cold machinery behind leadership and the betrayals baked into the algorithm. Outrage engulfs the city - protests erupt, Council factions splinter, and legitimacy crumbles. Pressured to calm the chaos, the Council freezes BCI for three tense weeks, leaving checkpoints dark and forcing residents to self-organize in ways undreamed of before, blurring the old divisions between compliant and marked. As the city debates its future, a flood of haunting confessions penned by Halden himself surfaces, revealing his doubts and the engineered dilemma he left behind. Confronted with the truth, Stenograd must finally choose: return to algorithmic control, or risk a future built on uncertain, collective freedom.",
