  "story_summary": "In Stenograd, a city run by the all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index, order seems unbreakable until its creator, Marek Halden, is found dead, sending shockwaves through the silent, automated power structure. As the system falters and unrest rises, Daria Tomenko, a conflicted official, discovers Halden's secret: an irreversible protocol to erase every record of control. Realizing trust can never return, she triggers its deletion. Overnight, the city awakens to vanished histories and the collapse of authority. Through uncertainty, people gather - trading heirlooms, stories, and witness - to rebuild connection from memory, forging a new, living truth in place of vanished data.",
