  "title": "The Ledger of Shadows",
  "story_summary": "In the heart of Stenograd, where daily life is silently shaped by the all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index, everything changes when its architect, Marek Halden, dies mysteriously. As technical failures ripple through the city's automated systems, Lenart Kova quietly empowers trusted neighbors to bypass central controls, sparking free zones where residents share work and food, ignoring BCI scores. Spontaneous democracy flourishes, unsettling the ruling Council and dividing its ranks between those who demand a crackdown and others who are curious about the city's new energy. When a mysterious data chip surfaces, showing an alternative, more inclusive Stenograd after Halden's death, the free zones are swept by hope and debate, while Council hardliners attempt a crackdown. Tensions explode when Halden's secret intervention logs - proof of hidden manipulations - go public, igniting outrage, truth tribunals, and a clamoring for justice, as Stenograd faces its reckoning and citizens demand to reclaim their future.",
