  "title": "Score Reversal Chaos",
  "story_summary": "In the tightly controlled city of Stenograd, governed by the all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index (BCI), everything changes the night its architect Marek Halden is found dead and mysterious messages - 'Halden Echoes' - flood the city, sparking hope, rumors, and division. As citizens debate their trust in the system and Council factions struggle to regain control, the discovery of a hidden archive of 'ghost' citizens - people thought erased but secretly still active in the BCI - throws Stenograd into chaos. Tensions soar when whistleblowers prove the invisible citizens' influence, prompting unrest and desperate factional responses. Suddenly, the city reels as the BCI's scores flip overnight: the compliant become outcasts, the marginalized gain sudden privilege. In the resulting turmoil, alliances form across old divides and the city rises in protest, forcing the once-invisible rulers to confront calls for justice and a new beginning.",
