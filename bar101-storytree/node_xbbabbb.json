  "title": "Redemption Games",
  "story_summary": "In 2025, Stenograd's quietly humming Behavioral Compliance Index begins to sputter after the sudden, mysterious death of its architect, Marek Halden, sending the city's carefully engineered order into disarray. As critical services fail and trust loops break, Lenart Kova, a conflicted technocrat, secretly steers the Council toward a desperate experiment: 'Redemption Games' that pit neighborhoods against moral challenges to restore their access to everyday life. Some communities band together, rediscovering old solidarities, while others crack under the pressure, wracked by quarrels over ethics and sacrifice. Rivalries spark as districts race to regain privileges, accusations of sabotage abound, and the city's faith in central authority begins to fray. By month's end, Council propaganda claims triumph, but a quiet revolution has begun - neighbors look to each other, and Stenograd discovers that cooperation and division now run deeper than any algorithm could predict.",

              "Neighborhoods are their own little councils now. Local power, local deals. The center holds, but barely.",
