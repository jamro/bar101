  "title": "Ghosts Without Shadows",
  "story_summary": "In 2025, Stenograd is ruled by the Behavioral Compliance Index, a system that quietly controls every life, until its architect Marek Halden dies and the city spirals into uncertainty. As authorities scramble to restore order, Oksana - troubled by warnings of unchecked surveillance - slips into the city's shadows and triggers the 'ghost' protocol, rendering select citizens invisible to all tracking. Panic mounts as undetectable 'ghosts' sabotage new control measures and expose hidden abuses, while paranoia spreads in a city now haunted by those it can neither see nor control. Forced to admit defeat, the Council confesses that full oversight is lost, and Stenograd enters an uneasy new era where freedom and fear inseparably entwine, trust forever altered by the invisible among them.",
