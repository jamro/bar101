  "title": "The Voluntary Disconnect",
  "story_summary": "In Stenograd, where the Behavioral Compliance Index quietly controls every citizen's life like invisible machinery, unrest grows as the system stumbles after its architect, Marek Halden, is found dead. Distrust in the ruling Council mounts, and debates flare everywhere - should the city cling to algorithmic order or claim digital autonomy? Rada Miskovic emerges from the shadows, rallying dissenters and sharing a bold declaration that calls for the right to disconnect. Soon, families mark their homes with chalk, signaling their choice to live analog - organizing barter, cooperation, and self-run services beyond the BCI's reach. As digital neighborhoods falter and shortages bite, adaptable analog communities prove resilient, forcing the Council to broker a tense truce. In the end, Stenograd becomes a city of uneasy coexistence - Halden's system no longer absolute, but surviving alongside the chalk-marked promise of autonomy.",
