  "title": "Reset and Rebirth",
  "story_summary": "In Stenograd, a city governed not by politicians but by algorithms, the Behavioral Compliance Index controls every aspect of life - until its architect, Marek Halden, dies mysteriously and the system begins to unravel. Oksana Lintz, a high-ranking official, secretly restores the digital identities of 'ghosts' - citizens once erased from existence - exposing cracks in the city's seamless order. As these untracked people reappear, fear and confusion ripple through the population, forcing the Council's rival factions into chaos. The discovery of a burned ledger revealing elite privilege exceptions ignites public outrage, fueling protests and deepening mistrust. Restored ghosts organize a public tribunal, testifying to disappearances and systemic abuse as Oksana reveals the troubling secrets behind the BCI's operations. In a desperate bid for legitimacy, the Council unleashes radical transparency, but the relentless exposure only breeds paranoia and mass resignations. Finally, Oksana triggers a full reset of the system, erasing all compliance scores. Freed from algorithmic control, Stenograd's citizens face confusion and hope, called by Halden's posthumous message to reinvent their future together.",
