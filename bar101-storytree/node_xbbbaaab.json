  "title": "The Doppelg\u00e4nger Dossier",
  "story_summary": "In the engineered calm of Stenograd, where daily life is guided by the all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index, the sudden death of Marek Halden - the city's supposed architect of order - shakes everything. But even greater tremors follow when Sven Halek, seeking truth over stability, reveals that 'Halden' never existed at all, but was a mask for the Council's secret collusion. News spreads like wildfire, igniting outrage and suspicion; alliances crumble as citizens turn on one another, unsure who to trust. Neighborhoods fracture into tribunals and accusations, demands for true justice running rampant while the dream of collective self-rule unravels. What once looked like perfect order dissolves into leaderless confusion, as the city faces the raw consequences of its own engineered deception.",
