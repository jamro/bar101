  "title": "Halden's Gambit Activated",
  "story_summary": "In the tightly controlled city of Stenograd, where the Behavioral Compliance Index quietly governs every aspect of life, chaos erupts when its architect, Marek Halden, is found dead and his failsafe triggers. Suddenly, every resident's privileges and restrictions are scrambled at random; elites face harsh limitations while the overlooked enjoy newfound freedom, forcing everyone to experience life from every rung of society. As routines collapse and confusion reigns, Council members Oksana and Rada scramble for solutions, while unlikely alliances form and passionate debates spill into the streets. The city must reckon with what justice and equality truly mean, culminating in a historic vote: should they return to the old ways of algorithmic control, or embrace a new future where every citizen has an equal voice?",
