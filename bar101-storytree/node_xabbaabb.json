  "story_summary": "In the surveillance city of Stenograd, where daily life is subtly ruled by the omnipresent Behavioral Compliance Index, a quiet storm brews when systems engineer Oksana Lintz dares to leak hidden ledgers exposing decades of Council corruption and privileged manipulation. The revelation crashes through the city like thunder, as citizens reel from the truth, Council members flee their posts, and crowds flood the streets in outrage. As old power structures crumble, those once marginalized - long ignored by the system - emerge to guide Stenograd's future. Embracing transparent, lottery-based councils and direct citizen voices, the people transform their city, forging a radically open government that breaks from secrecy toward shared control and hope.",
