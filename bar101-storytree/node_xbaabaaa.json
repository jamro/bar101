  "story_summary": "In 2025, Stenograd is ruled not by politicians but by the silent hand of the Behavioral Compliance Index (BCI), an all-seeing system engineered by Marek Halden to make obedience effortless and dissent invisible. When Halden is found dead, cracks appear in the city's flawless order. Lenart Kova, working quietly from the shadows, updates a popular puzzle app with secret clues that lead citizens to hidden lists of erased people - the system's discarded ghosts. As whispers grow into protests, Nikola Petrak leaks damning Council selection simulations, exposing how leaders rigged their rise. Public fury erupts into show trials and mass accusations. The Council scrambles to regain trust with a sham 'Transparency Protocol,' but vigilant citizens soon uncover its lies. Frustration blossoms into subtle rebellion, as people test and defy the weakening system. At last, Rada Miskovic sacrifices everything to release Halden's memory archive, unveiling the Council's deepest corruption. Stenograd's streets fill with truth-seekers; ordinary people take back power, demanding justice and writing a new future from Halden's ashes.",
