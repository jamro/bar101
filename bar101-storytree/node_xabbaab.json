  "title": "Scoreless Days",
  "story_summary": "In the city of Stenograd, where daily life is shaped by the all-powerful Behavioral Compliance Index, order is suddenly upended when its architect, Marek Halden, is found dead under mysterious circumstances and the system falters. With BCI shut down for two weeks, citizens are thrust into chaos but soon rediscover old instincts, forming neighborhood groups and building trust through improvised tokens rather than digital scores. As former outcasts rise as community leaders, a fragile sense of freedom and unity emerges - but tensions mount as the Council prepares to restore BCI, dividing the city between those desperate for a return to controlled normalcy and those yearning for lasting change, leaving Stenograd on the cusp of a new era.",
