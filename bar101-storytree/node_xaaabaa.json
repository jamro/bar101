  "story_summary": "In the shadowed city of Stenograd, where every life is measured and guided by the all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index, families begin to vanish - not in body, but in data, erased from existence and left helpless. Rada Miskovic, a determined journalist, exposes their plight, sparking outrage and swelling protests as the 'Vanished' gather in makeshift enclaves and hope for justice. When old BCI code is uncovered as the culprit, the ruling Council, desperate to quell the unrest, promises restoration. But this hope is a cruel illusion: those returned to the system find themselves secretly targeted by a harsh new 'shadow compliance' regime, their lives even more restricted. Outrage grows as whistleblowers leak proof of deception, fueling underground resistance and public fury. In a dramatic coup, restored citizens - helped by rebellious insiders - trigger a blackout in the BCI: all scores equalize, and for a fleeting moment, everyone shares true freedom. The Directorate scrambles to restore control, but the taste of equality has changed the city forever, forcing the Council to reckon with a society that will no longer accept algorithmic chains.",
