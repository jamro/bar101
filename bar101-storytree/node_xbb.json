  "title": "Order by Silence",
  "story_summary": "In 2025, the city of Stenograd runs on the invisible grip of the Behavioral Compliance Index, a system so seamless most residents hardly notice its watchful presence - until its architect, Marek Halden, is found dead and everything begins to unravel. Fearing chaos as the city's automated systems falter, security chief Sven Halek persuades the ruling Council to black out all civilian digital communication, plunging everyday life into a tense quiet. Cut off from familiar networks, citizens invent new ways to reach each other - scribbled notes, whispered messages - carrying leaked fragments of Halden's forbidden debates that question Council control. As distrust grows, people silently flood the boulevards, their united silence a powerful refusal to obey. By the month's end, the once-invisible system is naked, and the Council's grip is broken by the simple, relentless ingenuity of a population that refuses to be managed.",
