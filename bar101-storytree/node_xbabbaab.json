  "title": "Judgment by Consensus",
  "story_summary": "In the shadow of Stenograd's all-seeing Behavioral Compliance Index, the city is thrown into disarray when its quiet architect, Marek Halden, is found dead in his sealed home, sparking suspicion and fear in a society ruled by seamless algorithms. Oksana Lintz, disturbed by what she uncovers in Halden's private notebook, defies protocol to demand a rare act of transparency: a citizens' jury drawn from every layer of compliance. As testimonies of grief, praise, and anger fill the live-broadcast hearings, deep rifts are exposed - some see Halden as a misunderstood sentinel; others, a traitor in the machine. When the jury's inconclusive findings ignite passionate debate about blame and forgiveness, Stenograd fractures: council factions, grassroots leaders, and those once rendered invisible all vying to define the city's next chapter, as trust in the omnipresent system crumbles and a battle for the future quietly begins.",
