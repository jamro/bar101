  "title": "Truth on Trial",
  "story_summary": "In the eerie calm of Stenograd, where daily life is shaped by the invisible hand of the Behavioral Compliance Index, everything changes when Marek Halden, the system's unseen architect, is found dead inside his sealed residence. As the city's automated governance unravels - faltering checks, erratic decisions - Lenart Kova uncovers evidence of a rogue 'ghost' subsystem meddling in citizens' lives, its hidden trails signed by Halden himself. Boldly, Lenart risks everything to expose the truth, igniting citywide outrage and calls for justice. Under mounting pressure, the Council organizes an open tribunal, where survivors, whistleblowers, and engineers reveal the BCI's secret abuses and the roles of officials like Lenart, Oksana, and Daria, whose confession about reawakening Halden's protocol deepens the city's reckoning. Moved by painful testimonies and shaken allegiances, Stenograd's people gather for an unprecedented vote - facing the choice to reclaim power over the system or end the BCI's rule forever.",
