  "title": "Specter Protocol Unleashed",
  "story_summary": "In 2025, the city of Stenograd is ruled not by politicians, but by algorithms - its people's lives shaped by the Behavioral Compliance Index, the silent system Marek Halden built to make governance feel as seamless as infrastructure itself. When Halden is found dead, strange messages - his so-called 'Echoes' - begin to slip through the city's networks, unsettling a population schooled in quiet adaptation. As rumors pulse and Council factions fracture, journalist Rada Miskovic amplifies the uncertainty, igniting citywide debate about the system's fairness. Then a hidden archive of 'ghost' BCI profiles surfaces, revealing that hundreds once erased by the system still live in its shadow, fueling panic as residents realize the network may serve unseen hands. When the scoring protocols suddenly flip, throwing loyal citizens into exile and lifting outcasts into privilege, Stenograd descends into chaos. Now, as old ghosts reemerge with stories of vanished lives and memory-erasure protocols threaten to erase the truth itself, the city's fractured people unite in protest, demanding new answers - and forcing the Council to face the cost of a society steered by memory and algorithm instead of trust.",
