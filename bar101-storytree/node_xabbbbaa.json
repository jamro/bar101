  "title": "The Double Ledger",
  "story_summary": "In 2025, Stenograd's rigid order collapses after its architect, Marek Halden, is found dead and the city's all-powerful Behavioral Compliance Index falters. Frustrated by chaotic glitches and unfair reversals in BCI scores, residents - led by quiet dissidents like Daria Tomenko - disable the system's grip, wiping away privilege-based barriers overnight. Confusion quickly transforms into hope as service workers, teachers, and transit operators refuse to check scores, treating everyone equally and igniting a citywide push for 'score-blind' policies. Bolstered by Oksana Lintz's cautious support, the movement grows despite Directorate crackdowns. Hidden 'ghost' citizens return, and open assemblies demand a new civic future. When a shadow ledger exposes the Directorate's abuses and blackmail, public outrage boils over. Massive protests and tribunals force corrupt leaders out, as Stenograd's people abandon the BCI and seize the chance to rebuild trust and governance from the ground up.",
