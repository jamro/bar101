  "title": "Scoreless Elections",
  "story_summary": "In 2025, as the rigid, data-driven control of Stenograd's Behavioral Compliance Index begins to unravel after its architect Marek Halden's mysterious death, journalist Rada Miskovic faces a choice: expose painful truths of past abuses or inspire hope for a new era. Choosing the latter, Rada covers the bold push for the city's first open elections, where communities defy the central system and invite candidates once erased by algorithmic scores. Her reporting sparks citywide excitement, drawing citizens into heated rallies and unexpected alliances. Despite sabotage attempts from hardliners desperate to maintain order, transparent, analog voting triumphs, and the results deliver victory to grassroots and ghost candidates alike - marking the rebirth of collective, score-blind democracy and reshaping Stenograd's future.",
