  "title": "Algorithmic Afterlife",
  "story_summary": "In the coldly efficient city of Stenograd, daily life is governed not by politics, but by the invisible hand of the Behavioral Compliance Index - an all-powerful system built by Marek Halden to reward obedience and nudge outliers to the margins. When Halden is found dead, the city's ordered routines begin to falter: BCI scores behave erratically, chaos spreads as privileges invert, and a black market emerges for forged 'score skins.' Desperate to regain control, Council factions ignite a citywide blackout, pushing Stenograd back to a world of paper records and uneasy, face-to-face negotiations. Amid grassroots self-organization, a secret room is discovered - exposing how Directorate officials had secretly twisted the BCI to serve their own will and likely orchestrated Halden's fall. Outraged citizens, armed with damning resource maps, demand justice for years of calculated deprivation, forcing the embattled Council to convene a public Truth Tribunal. But as wounds and betrayals surface, a mysterious blackout erases the evidence - until fragments of Halden's adaptive code awaken, sending cryptic messages that divide the city. In the end, the self-erasing code leaves Stenograd uncertain, grappling with questions of justice, control, and whether true agency can ever exist beneath the shadow of an all-seeing system.",
