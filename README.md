# Bar 101: A Tale of Secrets in Stenograd

Welcome to Bar 101, a narrative-driven game set in the dystopian city of Stenograd, where you'll play as a bartender navigating a world controlled by the Behavioral Compliance Index (BCI) - an all-seeing system that scores every citizen's behavior in real-time.

## The World of Stenograd

By 2025, Stenograd has transformed into a city where governance looks more like infrastructure than politics. The BCI, a sophisticated system built by the late Marek Halden, monitors everything: government records, financial activity, transport data, online behavior, health systems, and biometric surveillance. Your BCI score determines your access to housing, services, and jobs. A low score brings delays, reroutes, and quiet denials.

But beneath this controlled surface lies Bar 101 - your sanctuary, hidden three stories underground in a disused tram station. Here, bureaucrats drink beside smugglers, system architects sit near off-grid ghosts, and everyone pretends not to listen. No cameras, no ID checks, no digital payments. Some think it's protected. Others think it's bait.

## Your Role as the Bartender

As Alex Radan, a former systems technician with a mysterious past, you'll:
- Mix drinks and build relationships with your customers
- Learn about the events shaping Stenograd's future
- Influence the city's future through your interactions
