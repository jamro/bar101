# Bar 101: A Tale of Secrets in Stenograd

Welcome to Bar 101, a narrative-driven game set in the dystopian city of Stenograd, where you'll play as a bartender navigating a world controlled by the Behavioral Compliance Index (BCI) - an all-seeing system that scores every citizen's behavior in real-time.

## Technology Stack

Bar 101 is built as a modern web application using **React.js** for the UI framework and **Pixi.js** for 2D rendering and game mechanics. The game's narrative and plot are dynamically generated using AI (**Open AI ChatGPT**) with custom **Python scripting** for story management. Visual assets are created through AI tools including **OpenAI**, **Midjourney**, and **VITS/VCTK** for voice synthesis. The entire infrastructure is managed as code on **AWS** using **Terraform**, providing a scalable and cost-effective hosting solution.

The game is an experiment in AI-driven game development. It explores how far generative AI can go in creating compelling, interactive content—from storylines and character behavior to visuals and audio—minimizing the need for traditional manual asset creation while maintaining an engaging player experience.

## The World of Stenograd

By 2025, Stenograd has transformed into a city where governance looks more like infrastructure than politics. The BCI, a sophisticated system built by the late Marek Halden, monitors everything: government records, financial activity, transport data, online behavior, health systems, and biometric surveillance. Your BCI score determines your access to housing, services, and jobs. A low score brings delays, reroutes, and quiet denials.

But beneath this controlled surface lies Bar 101 - your sanctuary, hidden three stories underground in a disused tram station. Here, bureaucrats drink beside smugglers, system architects sit near off-grid ghosts, and everyone pretends not to listen. No cameras, no ID checks, no digital payments. Some think it's protected. Others think it's bait.

- Mix drinks and build relationships with your customers
